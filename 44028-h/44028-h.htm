<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The object of this work, as will be seen, is to bring together the great
events of each day of the year, in all ages, as far as their dates can
be ascertained, and to arrange them chronologically. It has been
necessary to observe brevity in its compilation, in order to reduce it
within a proper compass. Hence notices of the most eminent men are often
confined to two or three lines, while individuals of less note have
occasionally received more attention, on account of the absence of ready
reference to them in books.</p>

<p>The dates are in accordance, it is believed, with the best authorities.
Great care has been taken to make them so, and nothing has been inserted
for which there was not at least some authority. Occasionally authors
have been found to disagree in days, months, and even years, and it has
been necessary to reconcile, as well as possible, such discrepancies.
Much of this confusion arises from the change in the calendar; some
authors following the old, others the new style, without informing us
which they adhere to. The protestant countries did not all adopt the new
style till 1777, about two centuries after the catholic authorities had
reformed the calendar. The Russians still use the Julian era, and are
now consequently twelve days behind the true time. With these
difficulties in the way, no ordinary vigilance ensures an entire freedom
from error in a work like this. The dates here, however, are made to
conform to the new style as far as practicable. In some cases where
different dates have been given, and it has been found impossible to
determine the true one, the article has been inserted under different
days with cross references. Repetitions have crept in however, which
could only be discovered in preparing the index. Errors of this kind are
perpetuated by a succession of authors <!-- Page iv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>following a wrong date, and are
exceedingly difficult to detect, or when suspected, not easily traced to
their origin. When dates have been taken from computations of time other
than the Christian era, it should be understood that the corresponding
day has been made to conform to our own era, and consequently perfect
accuracy can not be claimed for them.</p>

<p>It has been said that geography and chronology are the eyes of history;
in aiding to promote one of these sciences, the reader will not fail to
discover how great and varied is the amount of facts brought together,
rendering the work of use to persons of every age and calling. A
reference to the <a href="#General_Index">index</a> will show more clearly the extent of the work.</p>

<h3>JANUARY 1.</h3>

<p>154 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> It was fixed that the Roman consuls should always enter upon
their office on this day, and the years were named after them. On this
occasion they went in solemn procession to the Capitol to sacrifice to
Jupiter Capitolinus; after which the senate held a solemn session. Those
who had discharged the office of consul enjoyed the pre-eminence of rank
over the other senators. They were annually elected by the people till
the time of Tiberius, who ordered that they should be chosen by the
senate. The last consul after whom the year was named, was Barsilius, in
the year 541, in the reign of Justinianus.</p>

<p>38. <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> The Spanish era, or era of the Cæsars, commenced, being the
year following the conquest of Spain by Augustus. It was much used in
Africa, Spain and the south of France; but was abolished by one kingdom
after another during the fourteenth century, and by Portugal 1555.</p>

<p>404. <strong>Telemachus</strong>, or St. Almachus, whose story is the foundation of
Fenelon's famed work <cite>Telemaque</cite>, suffered martyrdom at Rome.</p>

<p>1109. The Festival of Fools was instituted at Paris, and continued
prosperous for 240 years. This, with the Lords of Misrule, and the
Abbots of Unreason, was doubtless designed to ridicule the Druidic
saturnalia.</p>

<p>1308. <strong>William Tell</strong>, the Swiss patriot, associated himself on this day
with a band of his countrymen against the tyranny of their oppressors.</p>

<p>1349. <strong>Edward III</strong>, king of England, defeated the French before Calais
with great slaughter.</p>

<p>1504. Birthday of <strong>Casper Cruciger</strong>, an extensive and multifarious
scholar, and a follower of Luther. He died 1548.</p>

<p>1515. <strong>Louis XII</strong> of France, surnamed <em>the father of the people</em>, died.
Notwithstanding the faults of his education, which had been purposely
neglected, he became a wise and politic monarch, who had the welfare and
improvement of his country in mind. Though extensively engaged in wars,
he avoided burdening the people with taxes—was economical, just and
magnanimous.</p>

<p>1513. <strong>Juan Diaz de Solis</strong>, coasting the southern continent, discovered
the mouth of a river on this day, which in consequence he called Rio
Janeiro.</p>

<p>1516. <strong>Juan Diaz de Solis</strong> again entered the Rio de Solis which he had
discovered three years previous. In attempting a descent on the country
he was slain by the natives, who in sight of the ship cut his body in
pieces, and roasted and devoured it. He was reputed the ablest navigator
in the world.</p>

<p>1523. Knights of Malta driven from the island of Rhodes by the Turks.</p>

<p>1537. <strong>James V</strong> of Scotland married Magdalen, daughter of Francis I of
France.</p>

<p>1617. <strong>Henry Goltzius</strong>, a distinguished Dutch painter and engraver, died.
His father was a painter on glass, and gave his son instructions in the
art; but it was his own genius and application that raised him to the
rank he ultimately held among the best artists of the time.</p>

<p>1618. Charter of the first New Netherland company expired by its own
limitation.</p>

<p>1618. Birthday of <strong>Bartholomew Esteban Murillo</strong>, the greatest of all the
Spanish painters. He was employed by the churches and convents of
Seville a great number of years, which were enriched by the masterly
productions of his pencil, and procured for himself an independent
fortune. Having been invited to Cadiz, he there executed his grand
picture of St. Catharine; but just as he was about to finish it he was
dreadfully wounded on the scaffolding, and died at Seville, 1682.</p>

<p>1630. <strong>Thomas Hobson</strong>, the celebrated <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>carrier of Cambridge, England,
died. One of the most general proverbial expressions in England
originated with him. He let to students and others horses, and his
practice was to secure equal portions of rest as well as work for each
horse. Hence when applied to for any, none but that which had its due
proportion of rest could be let. "This or none" was the answer. Hence
the phrase "Hobson's choice; this or none."</p>

<p>1644. <strong>Michob Ader</strong>, calling himself the Wandering Jew, appeared at Paris,
where he created an extraordinary sensation among all ranks. He
pretended to have lived sixteen hundred years, and that he had traveled
through all regions of the world. He was visited by the literati of the
city, and no one could accost him in a language that he was ignorant of;
he was also familiar with the history of persons and events from the
time of Christ, so that he was never confounded by intricate or
cross-questions; but replied readily and without embarrassment. The
learned looked upon him as a counterfeit, or madman, yet they took their
leave of him bewildered and astonished.</p>

<p>1651. <strong>Charles II</strong> crowned king of Scotland at Scone.</p>

<p>1661. A parliament met in Scotland.</p>

<p>1700. The Russians began their new year.</p>

<p>1715. <strong>William Wycherley</strong> died, aged 81, an eminent English dramatic
writer and comic poet.</p>

<p>1727. <strong>Claude Adrian Helvetius</strong> died; a celebrated Dutch physician, who,
having obtained celebrity by introducing the use of ipecacuanha in
dysentery, was made inspector general of military hospitals, and died at
London.</p>

<p>1729. Great fog in London, persons lost their way in St. James' park,
and many fell into the canal.</p>

<p>1730. <strong>Samuel Sewall</strong>, chief justice of the supreme court of Massachusetts
died.</p>

<p>1731. <strong>Edward Cave</strong> printed the first number of the well known
<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>1748. Birthday of <strong>Godfrey Augustus Burger</strong>, a celebrated German poet, and
the writer of that whimsical satire, <cite>Munchausen's Travels</cite>.</p>

<p>1748. <strong>John Bernouilli</strong>, a Swiss mathematician, died. He was born at Basil
in Switzerland, and educated for a merchant, but afterwards studied
medicine, and finally devoted his attention to mathematics with great
success. He was the contemporary of Leibnitz and De L'Hopital, and of
Newton. His labors in the science were indefatigable, and his works
contain an immense mass of discovery. But the details of his private
life exhibit an unusual degree of acerbity and disingenuousness.</p>

<p>1752. The new style commenced this day in England by act of parliament.
(See <a href="#March_25_1751">March 25</a>.)</p>

<p>1757. Calcutta surrendered to the British under Admiral Watson, Colonel
Clive and Captain Coote.</p>

<p>1761. Great hurricane in the East Indies, destroying a part of the
British fleet; of the crews of three of the ships lost but 14 were saved
out of 1100.</p>

<p>1776. Norfolk Burnt. Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia,
having abandoned the town and retired on board his ships, became
distressed for provisions; and on the arrival of the Liverpool man of
war, the inhabitants refusing to supply his majesty's ships, the place

died. He was a native of South Carolina, born 1743, and educated in
England; and at the age of twenty-two made the tour of Europe. On the
breaking out of the war he engaged warmly on the side of the colonies.
In 1779 he distinguished himself in the defence of Charleston against
the British, who afterwards ravaged his plantation and rifled his
mansion, by which he suffered an immense loss of property; and in the
following year he was taken prisoner. On the termination of the contest
he returned to his native seat, and spent the remainder of his life in
elegant and philosophical ease—a model of private wealth and public
virtue; a firm patriot and an enlightened philanthropist.</p>

society; and his mild and even temper and kind disposition gained him
the love of all who knew him.</p>

<h3>JANUARY 2.</h3>

<p>17. <strong>Titus Livius</strong> died at Padua. His history of Rome, to which he devoted
twenty years, rendered him so celebrated, that a Spaniard is said to
have gone from Cadiz to Rome for the purpose merely of seeing him. His
history was written in 140 books, of which only 35 are extant. Five of
these were discovered at Worms 1731, and some fragments are said to have
been since found at Herculaneum. Few particulars of his life are known,
but his fame was great even while he lived, and his history has made him
immortal.</p>

<p>17. <strong>Publius Ovidus Naso</strong>, the Roman poet, died in exile at Tomos (a town
on the inhospitable coast of the Black sea), aged 60. He exhibited an
unconquerable predilection for poetry, and the ease and the enjoyments
of life, which his fortune placed within his power. He traveled in
Greece and Asia which added to his accomplishments; his works were
adapted to the public taste, and he was esteemed by the learned: Horace
and Virgil were his friends, and he was a welcome visitor at the court
of Augustus. Until his fiftieth year he appears to have lived almost
solely for poetry and pleasure. He might have hoped to pass the
remaining years of his life in peace, under the shadow of his laurels,
but he was suddenly banished by Augustus, for some unknown cause. His
<cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, and <cite>Art of Love</cite> are often republished in our
language. He painted nature with a masterly hand, and his genius
imparted elegance to vulgarity; but impurity defiles the sweetness of
his numbers, and his finest productions are sullied with licentiousness.</p>

<p>1547. Conspiracy of Genoa, headed by John Lewis Fiesco; his being
drowned in the night, occasioned the failure of the scheme, in the very
moment of success.</p>

<p>1766. <strong>James Edward Francis Stuart</strong>, the Pretender, died. He was the
eldest son of James II, born at London 1688. He was five months old when
his father was dethroned, and the royal family fled to France. His elder
sister Anne afterwards came to the throne, and some effort was made to
secure his own succession; but it does not appear that he entered into
the project with much spirit.</p>

<p>1771. <strong>Lewis Cæsar</strong>, count d'Estrees, marshal of France, and minister of
state, died aged 76. He distinguished himself in the war against Spain,
and afterwards in 1741, wherein his bravery was conspicuous and his
services meritorious. In 1756 he was placed at the head of the French
forces in Germany, but was superceded by Richelieu through intrigue.</p>

<p><a name="Jan_2_1774" id="Jan_2_1774"></a>1774. The coffin of <strong>Edward I</strong> opened by a deputation from the society of
antiquarians, after it had been buried 467 years. In a coffin of yellow
stone they found the royal body in perfect preservation, enclosed in two
wrappers; one of them was gold tissue, strongly waxed and fresh; the
other and outermost considerably decayed. The corpse was habited in a
rich mantle of purple lined with white and adorned with ornaments of
gilt metal, studded with red and blue stones and pearls. Two similar
ornaments lay on the hands. The mantle was fastened on the right
shoulder by a magnificent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fibula</i> of the same metal, with the same
stones and pearls. His face had over it a silken covering, so fine, and
so closely fitted to it, as to preserve the features entire. Round his
temples was a gilt coronet of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur de lys</i>. In his hands, which were
also entire, were two sceptres of gilt metal; that in the right
surmounted by a cross fleure, that in the left by three clusters of oak
leaves, and a dove on a globe. The feet enveloped in the mantle and
other coverings were sound and the toes distinct. Its length was 6 feet
2 inches.</p>

<p>1777. Cannonading at Trenton; the British repulsed in their attempt to
cross Sanpink creek bridge. In the night Gen. Washington retired leaving

refused without the whole of his charge, and therefore sailed into
Spithead.</p>

<p><a name="Jan_2_1801" id="Jan_2_1801"></a>1801. <strong>John Gasper Christian Lavater</strong> died. He was born at Zurich, in
Switzerland, where his father was a physician of skill and reputation.
In 1763 he traveled in Germany; in 1767 appeared as a poet; and in 1769
as a preacher of much popularity. All his activity was devoted to
religion until he undertook his work on physiognomy. This great work in
4 vols. quarto, in which he had collected the features of distinguished
persons from all parts of the world, made him known throughout Europe.
He published several other works, and became so popular that his
journeys resembled triumphs. On the capture of Zurich by Massena, he
received a shot while assisting the wounded in the street, which
although he lived more than a year, and wrote several works, was the
cause of his death.</p>

<p>1809. Two French ships of war and eleven victualers, proceeding to

born at Dijon 1737, and distinguished himself in 1773 by the invention
of the method of purifying the air by means of chlorine. He was an
upright, able, eloquent and business man; and founded a school at Dijon
for the study of his favorite science, chemistry. He was a member of the
national assembly and convention at the time of the revolution, and
assisted to establish the polytechnic school.</p>

<p>1827. <strong>John Mason Good</strong>, an English physician, poet and philological
writer, died. At the age of 15 he was apprenticed to a surgeon; in 1793
removed to London, and by talent and perseverance, succeeded in
establishing both a literary and professional fame. He was a voluminous
writer, and the extent and variety of his works evince the greatest
industry, and a retentive and orderly mind. He acquired thirteen
European and Asiatic languages, and at the time of his death had just
completed a translation of the Psalms.</p>

<p>1829. Forty men and thirty horses destroyed by an explosion of fire damp
in a mine near Lyons, France.</p>

<p>1831. <strong>Berthold George Niebuhr</strong> the historian, died. He was the son of
Niebuhr the traveler, born at Copenhagen 1777, and finished his
education at Edinburgh. He traveled much and received great attention
wherever he went. In 1810 he delivered his lectures on Roman history at
Berlin; and in 1815, on the death of his father, planned and published
his biography. In 1827 he published the first volume of a remodeled
edition of his Roman history; the second volume appeared a few months
before his death, leaving the third unpublished.</p>

at an early age; and in 1639 was engaged in the unfortunate expedition
of Charles I against the Scots. He was confined three years in the Tower
under the parliament, during which he wrote a work on military and
political affairs; but finally accepted a commission in the republican
army <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>against the Irish, the Scotch and the Dutch. But at the death of
the Protector he employed his influence to reinstate the Stuarts. In
1666 he was again employed against the son of his old antagonist Tromp,
in which the English fleet was much damaged, and both claimed the
victory.</p>

<p>1717. <strong>Lambert Boss</strong>, an eminent Dutch philologist, died. He was born in
Friesland 1670; studied under his father who was a clergyman, became
private tutor in a family of rank, and subsequently professor of Greek
in the university of Franeker. He was an indefatigable student, and
regretted every moment which could not be devoted to his favorite
pursuit. The number and character of his works mark his industry.</p>

<p>1795. <strong>Josiah Wedgewood</strong> died. His father was a Staffordshire potter, to
whose business he succeeded, and soon distinguished himself by his

neighbors. He was a scientific, as well as an active and enterprising
man—and benevolent withal.</p>

<p>1805. <strong>Alexander Wedderburn</strong>, lord of Rosslyn, died. He distinguished
himself as a lawyer, and was appointed solicitor general in 1771, in

pass his childhood among the people whom he was destined to govern. He
served his first campaign under Montellucco against Turenne. He was in
Vienna when that city was besieged by the Turks, and subsequently
commanded against the Turks in the Danube. He was one of the greatest
generals of his time; made 26 campaigns, commanded at 25 sieges, fought
at 13 battles, yet was never really defeated.</p>

His works are published in 7 vols.</p>

<p>1825. <strong>Ferdinand IV</strong> of Naples died. The life of this prince is remarkable
for the uncommon length of his reign, and its many vicissitudes,
embracing a period of 65 years, and being closely connected with all the
great events of Europe during the last half century. He was born 1751,
and came to the throne at the age of eight. The first thirty years of
his reign were attended with peace and happiness; but in 1798 the
country was invaded by Bonaparte, before whom Ferdinand fled to Sicily:
and afterwards in 1820 the Carbonari effected a revolution which again
banished the royal family. The interposition of the Austrians, however,
restored the ancient order of things, which continued till the death of
the king, four years after.</p>

<p>1827. <strong>James Chambers</strong>, an eccentric poet, died in misery at a farm-house
in Stratbroke, England. From the age of 16 to 70 he wandered about the
country, gaining a precarious subsistence by selling his own effusions,
of which he had a number printed in a cheap form. His compositions were
mostly suggested to him by his muse, during the stillness of the night
while reposing in some friendly barn or hay-loft. When so inspired, he
would arise and commit the effusion to paper. He continued through life
in hopeless poverty, and was a lonely man and a wanderer, who had
neither act nor part in the common ways of the world.</p>

<h3>JANUARY 5.</h3>

<p>62. <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> <strong>Lucius Sergius Catiline</strong>, the Roman conspirator, killed in
Etruria. The history of his life unfolds a series of most revolting
crimes; but there is reason to believe that some of them are unreal.
Murder, rapine and conflagration, were the<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>first pleasures of his life.
Pompey, Crassus and Cæsar favored his schemes with a view to their own
aggrandizement. Only two Romans remained determined to uphold their
falling country—Cato and Cicero. The speeches of the latter in the
Roman senate on the crisis of affairs are imperishable monuments of
eloquence and patriotism, and produced the overthrow of the
conspirators. Five of them were put to death, and Catiline being
surrounded by the army under Petreius resolved to die sword in hand. The
battle was fought with desperation, and the insurgents fell, with their
leader at their head.</p>

<p>1066. <strong>Edward</strong> the Confessor, king of England, died. He was called to the
throne 1041. He was not the immediate heir, but his claim was supported
of Godwin, earl of Kent, whose daughter Editha he married. He was a weak
and superstitious prince, and acquired the title of <em>Saint</em> or
<em>Confessor</em>, by abstaining from nuptial connection with his queen. He
was the first English monarch who undertook to cure the <em>king's-evil</em> by
touching the patient. With him ended the Saxon line of kings.</p>

<p>1477. <strong>Charles</strong> the Bold, duke of Burgundy, killed in battle on this or
the following day. This prince, the son of Philip the Good and Isabella
of Portugal, early displayed a violent, impetuous and ambitious
disposition; and in after life was constantly embroiled in unjust and
cruel warfare, in which he performed many daring exploits. But having
turned his arms against the Swiss, the fortune of war turned against
him; and being deserted by his allies, with his usual temerity risked a
battle with only 4000 men against a vastly superior force, was defeated
and killed by the thrust of a lance in the 44th year of his age. His
body covered with blood and mire, and his head imbedded in the ice, was
not found till two days after the battle, when it was so disfigured that
his own brother did not recognize it. With him expired the feudal
government of Burgundy.</p>

<p>1531. The electoral college assembled at Rome and elected Ferdinand,
brother of Charles V, king of the Romans. He was crowned a few days
after at Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>1536. <strong>Catharine of Arragon</strong>, the repudiated queen of Henry VIII, died.
She was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, born 1483. She
was first married to Arthur, prince of Wales, who died five months
after; and the king unwilling to return her dowry caused her to be
contracted to his remaining son, Henry. The prince, at the age of 15,
made a public protest against this proceeding, but finally consented to
the match. Notwithstanding the inequality of their ages and the
capricious disposition of the king, they had been married 20 years when
the division took place. This separation led to a divorce from the pope
also, and was the cause of mighty effects.</p>

<p>1559. <strong>Catharine de Medicis</strong> died. She was born at Florence 1519; married,
1533, the dauphin, afterwards Henry II, of France. She was three times
regent of France, and during her administration made a conspicuous
figure in the annals of Europe by her political genius. By her was begun
the palace of the Tuilleries; but the lasting monument of her fame and
iniquity is the massacre of St. Bartholomew's, which was brought about
by her intrigues, when more than 50,000 protestants were massacred in
one day.</p>

<p>1621. <strong>Paul Van Somer</strong> died in London. He was born at Antwerp, 1576, and
arrived at great proficiency as a painter. His pencil was chiefly
employed on portraits of royal and eminent personages, and is said to
have equalled Vandyke.</p>

<p>1636. <strong>De Vries</strong>, who had recently arrived from Holland in the capacity of
a patroon, sent his colonists over to Staten island from fort Amsterdam,
to commence the colony and buildings.</p>

<p>1675. <strong>Turenne</strong> defeated the imperialists at Turkheim.</p>

<p>1705. Second volcanic opening of the peak of Teneriffe, in the ravine of
Almerchiga, a league from Icore. It closed on the 13th of the same
month.</p>

<p>1722. <strong>Bell</strong>, the Traveler, arrived at Moscow on the return from China.
(See <a href="#July_14_1719">July 14, 1719</a>.) The account of this journey, and of what he saw and
learned at Pekin, is the most valuable part of his book, and one of the
best and most interesting relations ever written by any traveler.</p>

<p>1724. <strong>Czartan Petrarch</strong> died, aged 184, at a village near Temeswar, in
Hungary. He was born in the year 1539; and at the time the Turks took
Temeswar from the Christians he was employed in keeping his father's
cattle. A few days before his death he had walked with the help of a
stick to the post house to ask charity of the travelers. His hair and
beard were of a greenish-white color, like mouldy bread; and he had a
few of his teeth remaining, and enjoyed a little eyesight. His son, who
was ninety-seven years of age, declared that his father had married at
an extreme age, for the third time, and that he was born in this last
marriage. He had descendants in the fifth generation, with whom he
sometimes sported, carrying them in his arms. His son, though
ninety-seven, was still fresh and vigorous. The <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>commandant of Temeswar
on learning of his sickness, caused his portrait to be painted, and it
was nearly finished when he expired.</p>

<p>1757. <strong>Damiens</strong> attempted the assassination of Louis XV, for which he was
condemned to the most cruel tortures, and finally quartered by four
horses. (See <a href="#March_28_1757">March 28</a>.)</p>

<p>1764. A comet was first seen at Tewkesbury, England, near two small

Dumas of 20 guns, off Deseada.</p>

<p>1796. <strong>Samuel Huntington</strong>, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. He was born at Windham, Ct., 1732; his father being
a farmer could allow him only a common school education; but his own
assiduity made up the deficiency, so that at the age of 22 he commenced
the study of the law with borrowed books; in 1764 he was sent to the
general assembly; 1765 appointed king's attorney; 1774 raised to the
bench of the supreme court; 1775 sent a delegate to the general congress
of the colonies, and in 1779 succeeded John Jay as president of
congress. At the time of his death he was governor of Connecticut.</p>

a duel, firing his pistol in the air; 1791 married the eldest daughter

Flanders at the head of the British army, and in the end showed himself

<h3>JANUARY 6.</h3>

<p>1402. Birthday of <strong>Joan of Arc</strong>.</p>

<p>1540. <strong>Henry VIII</strong> married Anne, daughter of John, duke of Cleves. This
was his fourth wife. He had asked her hand in marriage after having seen
a portrait of her by Holbein; and becoming disgusted with her in six
months bestowed upon her the epithet of <em>Flanders mare</em>, and sent her
home. She retired, not much disconcerted, to her own country, where she

<p>1734. <strong>John Dennis</strong>, an English dramatist and critic, died. He was the son
of a saddler, born in London 1657, and liberally educated. His first
play appeared in 1697, and was followed by many dramatic pieces and
poems which were sufficiently worthless to procure their author an
imperishable notoriety in the <cite>Dunciad</cite>, where Pope has gibbeted him. He
squandered a fortune which had been left him by an uncle, and not being
able to subsist by his pamphlets and criticisms for the magazines,
depended upon his friends for a living; and even those whom he had made
his enemies joined in the benefit for him at the Haymarket theatre,
after he had become blind and partially insane. One of his plays, which
was condemned, is famous for a new kind of thunder introduced in it; a
few nights after its representation, the players made use of the
contrivance in Macbeth, when the author rose in the pit and with an oath
claimed it as his thunder. His <em>thunder</em> is said to be that still used
in the theatres.</p>

<p>1738. <strong>Jean Baptist Labat</strong>, a missionary and traveler, died. He was born
at Paris 1663, and became a Dominican priest in Norway, where he taught

visited all the Antilles. When the English attacked the island of
Guadaloupe, he rendered his country important services as an engineer.
He afterwards traveled much in Europe, and published his travels. His
voyage to the West Indies has been translated into several languages,
and is a truly scientific work.</p>

people.</p>

with the king, who considered it a satire upon his reign. During the
revolution of 1793 his coffin was dug up to furnish lead for bullets. In
1819 a monument was erected to his memory by public subscription, and in
1826 a statue by the sculptor David was placed at Cambray. The age in

<cite>Farmer's Museum</cite> at Walpole, in which he published a series of popular
essays under the signature of The Lay Preacher. He was afterwards editor
of the <cite>Port Folio</cite> at Philadelphia, where his superior endowments would
have procured him an independence, but for some unfortunate propensities
which deprived him of health and happiness.</p>

<p>1822. Liberia in Africa colonized under the direction of Dr. Ayres. Cape

originally published in 10 vols.</p>

<p>1561. The first English tragedy performed, at Whitehall, before the
queen. It was entitled <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, from the name of a supposed ancient
British king, and was written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton. It
consists of five acts, each preceded by a dumb show, prefiguring what is
to occur; the first four acts close by choruses in rhyme, and the fifth
by a didactic speech of nearly two hundred lines. Sir Philip Sydney
pronounced it "full of stately speeches and well-sounding phrases,
climbing to the height of Seneca his stile, and full of notable
morality, which it doth most delightfully teach."</p>

was the son of the marchioness de Bouffleurs, mistress of Stanislaus,
king of Poland. He distinguished himself in the army, which however he

<p>1514. <strong>Vasco Nunez de Balboa</strong> returned to his colony at Darien, after
having made the discovery of the Pacific ocean. His expedition occupied
four months and a half; his triumph was complete. The whole population
poured down to the shore to meet him, to hail him as the author of their
fortunes, as less a man than a gift of heaven, to guide them into the
possession of glories and riches incalculable. The expedition had been
undertaken in consequence of the extravagant representations by the
Indians, of a people who lived on the borders of that ocean, six suns
distant, who owned large ships, and whose eating and drinking vessels
were of pure gold. They referred to the Peruvians.</p>

printer, Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>1547. <strong>Henry Howard</strong>, earl of Surrey, a soldier, scholar and poet,
beheaded on Tower hill for treason. In his youth he made the tour of
Europe, and at Florence signalized his courage and romantic spirit, by
publishing, in the style of a knight-errant, a challenge to all comers,
Christians, Jews, Saracens, Turks and Cannibals, in defence of the
surpassing beauty of his mistress, the fair Geraldine; and was
victorious at the tournament instituted by the grand duke on the
occasion. He served in the army sent against Scotland in 1542, and in
1544 accompanied the troops with which the king invaded France. For his
services he was promoted, but being defeated in an attempt to seize a
convoy, he was superseded. This unmerited disgrace was the beginning of
his ruin. He is said to have aspired to the hand of the Princess Mary,
and on some frivolous charges was tried by a common jury, by whom he was
obsequiously found guilty of treason. Thus perished a man "no less
valiant than learned, and of excellent hopes," aged 27.</p>

<p>1565. <strong>James Laynez</strong>, one of the founders of the Society of Jesus, died.
He was born in Castile, 1512. His intimacy with Loyola was formed in

began to write poetry, and made verses and shoes, plays and pumps, with
equal assiduity, to the age of 77, when he took an inventory of his
literary stock in trade. It consisted of 4200 songs, 508 comedies, and
other pieces, in all 6048, making 32 folio volumes written by his own
hand. From these a selection was published in 5 volumes folio. His poems
are distinguished for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>, feeling, and striking description.</p>

<p>1657. <strong>Miles Syndercombe</strong> and others convicted of plotting the death of

accomplished scholar and a good speaker, but declined all public
employment, being wholly engrossed in gallantry and pleasure. He was the
patron of poets and men of wit: his own productions are those of a man
of wit, vigorous, gay and airy. He served in the Dutch war of 1665 as a
volunteer, and on the night before an engagement, composed the
celebrated song, beginning, "To all you ladies now at hand."</p>

<p>1728. <strong>William Congreve</strong>, the English dramatist, died. He was educated for
the bar, but like many others similarly situated, gave up the law for
the pursuit of polite literature, in which he was eminently successful.

produced his first comedy at the age of 21.</p>

Indian wars of 1755. He joined the patriots of the revolution, and

latter engagement, of which he died. His funeral was attended by 30,000
people.</p>

by the legislature with a house and lot in Savannah. He held various
civil offices in the state, and at the time of his death was a senator
in congress.</p>

minister of state, died, aged 74. It is said of him that during nearly
sixty years of warfare against different enemies, he never lost a
battle, and was never taken by surprise. He was undoubtedly the ablest
general of his age; had a proud mien, a noble aspect and a strong frame;
slept little, labored and wrote much. But pride, severity and cruelty
tarnished his renown, so that he became odious even to his own
countrymen.</p>

<p>1609. <strong>Joseph Justus Scaliger</strong> died, aged 69. His education commenced
early, and he was one of the most indefatigable students through a long
life, that was ever known. So entirely immersed was he in his studies,
that he passed whole days in his chamber without eating or drinking, and
paid very little attention to the common <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>affairs of life. He may be
called the founder of the science of chronology.</p>

<p>1666. <strong>Shah Jehan</strong>, a Mogul emperor, died, aged 74. He was the son and

and energetic sovereign that ruled over the Mogul empire of Hindostan.
From his 20th year, military duties devolved upon him; he raised a body
of troops, and obtained the government of the Deccan. He invited his old
friends the fakirs, or religious mendicants, to a feast, and compelled
them to put on new and decent clothing. The gold and silver pieces which
he found on burning their old garments, was of great service to him in
prosecuting the war against his elder brother for the sovereignty. He
stirred up dissensions among his brothers, by which they were put out of
his way, shut up his father in his harem, and in 1659 ascended the
throne. Notwithstanding his cruelty he governed with much wisdom, and
consulted the welfare of his people. Two of his sons endeavoring to form
a party in their own favor, he caused to be put to death by slow poison.
In the midst of his activity he died at Ahmednagar, and with his death
terminated the brilliant epoch of the Moguls.</p>

<p>1733. <strong>Bernard de Mandeville</strong>, an English author, died. He was born at
Dort in Holland, and went to England to practice medicine. Meeting with
poor encouragement, he turned author; but his topics, though professedly
intended for the promotion of the public morals, introduced him to the
notice of the grand jury. His pen procured the means of subsistence, but
acquired for him an unenviable notoriety.</p>

<p>1750. <strong>John Bland</strong>, the renowned writing master, died at his academy in
London.</p>

<p>1759. Battle of Wandewash, in India. The French under Lally defeated

Advertiser</cite>; and the last number was also published on this day, 1772.</p>

<p>1773. <strong>Alexis Piron</strong>, a French dramatist, died. His first effusions were
satires, which procured him so many enemies that even in the latter part
of his life he could not get admission into the Academy. He revenged
himself by calling them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les invalides du bel esprit</i>, and composing his
own humorous epitaph:</p>

<div class="poemit" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Ci-git Piron, qui ne fut rien,</div>
    <div class="line">Pas même académicien.</div>

<p>1793. <strong>Louis XVI</strong> beheaded at Paris, aged 38. He had reigned 17 years and
7 months, and is now represented as an amiable and benevolent man,
anxious to make his subjects happy; who in turn treated him in the
vilest manner, and executed him as a tyrant and a traitor. His behavior
on many trying occasions vindicated him effectually of timidity, and
showed that the unwillingness to shed blood by which he was particularly
distinguished, arose from benevolence, and not from pusillanimity. Upon
the scaffold he exhibited a firmness that became a noble spirit.</p>

<p>1814. <strong>Jacques Bernardin Henry de St. Pierre</strong>, a French philosophical
writer, died, at his estate near Paris. He is best known as the author
of <cite>Paul and Virginia</cite>, which appeared in 1788, and passed through fifty
editions in one year. It has been generally translated in Europe.</p>

<p>1815. <strong>Matthias Claudius</strong>, a German poet, died. His prose and poetry are
said to bear a peculiar stamp of humor, frankness and cordiality, and
many of his songs, set to music by the first composers, have become a
part of the national melodies. He filled several public offices.</p>

<p>1816. Day of general mourning in France, on account of the death of
Louis XVI, twenty-three years after his execution.</p>

<p>1820. <strong>Ambroise Marie Francis Joseph Palisot de Beauvais</strong>, a French
naturalist, died. He came to America in the pursuit of science, and
while at Philadelphia learnt that he had been proscribed by the
<!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>revolutionists as an emigrant. He supported himself as a teacher of
music and languages until the arrival of the French minister, who
afforded Palisot the means of prosecuting inquiries into the natural
history of America. He was employed to arrange Peale's collection. On
returning to France with his rich collections, he was admitted into the
Institute, in the place of Adanson.</p>

<p>1824. <strong>Charles Macarthy</strong> killed. He commanded at the Cape-Coast against
the Ashantees. Whilst making preparations to repel these savages in
1821, the king sent his compliments to him, and said he hoped to have
his head as an ornament to their great war drum. Subsequently Sir
Charles marched against the enemy with a mixed force of Europeans and
blacks; the latter ran away, and the whites being defeated and their
commander captured, the ferocious menace was realized. The trophy
however was afterwards recovered.</p>

exclusive patent for printing music, for the term of twenty-one years.</p>

<p>1683. <strong>Anthony Ashley Cooper</strong>, first earl of Shaftsbury, died. The career
of this able, but dubious and versatile statesman was cast in a stormy
period, and his acts have been severely reprehended. Yet much of it is
to be attributed to the odium excited by opposing party feelings. His
vices appear to have been redeemed by corresponding virtues, and had he
appeared in a different age, it is likely he would have developed a
different character.</p>

<p>1689. The British parliament having met under the name of a convention,
declared that the king, James II, had abdicated the throne. William and
Mary succeeded him.</p>

<p>1696. Birthday of <strong>James Brucker</strong>, a German scholar, remembered by his

<p>1800. <strong>George Stevens</strong> died, best known as the editor of Shakspeare,

testimonials. His literary collections were extremely curious, and as
regards the days that are gone, of great value.</p>

<p>1809. Naval action off Guadaloupe between the British frigate Cleopatra
and sloop of war Hazard, and the French frigate Topaz, 40 guns. The
engagement lasted 45 minutes, and resulted in the capture of the Topaz,

<p>1810. The French forced the passage of the Sierra Morena, in Spain.</p>

<p>1813. Second battle of Frenchtown in Michigan. The van of Gen.
Harrison's army, about 750 men, was attacked at day break by 2000
British and Indians under Proctor and Tecumseh. Notwithstanding the
superiority of the latter in numbers, the Americans fought with
desperation six hours, when they surrendered. British loss, as stated by
Proctor, 24 killed, 128 wounded; the loss of the Indians is supposed to
have been greater. American loss, 200 killed, 522 prisoners, 27 escaped.

<p>1818. <strong>Caspar Wistar</strong> died, a distinguished physician of Philadelphia. He
was of German parentage, and a member of the society of Friends; became
eminent as an anatomist, and corresponded with Cuvier and other eminent
naturalists of Europe. He held scientific meetings at his own house, and
was an active contributer to knowledge of all kinds. He died of a slow
fever, caught by attending a poor family in a close apartment.</p>

<p>1822. <strong>John Julius Angerstein</strong> died, celebrated as the founder of the
British national gallery, which was purchased by the government after

in it till 1813, when he was honorably discharged, on account of his
disability, having suffered a stroke of paralysis.</p>

<p>1840. <strong>John Frederick Blumenbach</strong> died at Göttingen, aged 88. He was long
a distinguished professor at the university, and a very eminent
naturalist. His collection of skulls was said to be the richest in the
world. The 50th year of his professorship was celebrated in 1826.</p>

<p>1849. <strong>John C. Calhoun's</strong> draft of an address to the people of the United
States adopted in preference to Berrien's, and the Southern convention
adjourned sine die.</p>

<p>1854. <strong>Patrick O'Donahoe</strong> died at Brooklyn, N. Y.; one of the Irish exiles
who escaped from Van Diemen's Land.</p>


<h3>JANUARY 23.</h3>

<p>1401. <strong>Tamerlane</strong> introduced his troops into the city of Damascus, in
violation of a truce; and after levying an enormous contribution in
gold, massacred the inhabitants, and reduced the city to ashes, in
revenge of the murder of the grandson of Mahomet, seven centuries
before, by the Syrians.</p>

<p>1516. <strong>Ferdinand V</strong> of Spain died. He inherited the crowns of Aragon and
Sicily, and united to them the kingdom of Castile by marriage. In 1492
he added to these the kingdom of Granada, the last possession of the
Moors, by conquest; at the same time Columbus was discovering for him
the new world. By force and treachery he acquired the kingdom of Naples,
and by similar means Navarre was also added to his dominions. Thus the
whole of Spain was united under him; so that he may be considered as the
restorer if not the founder of the Spanish monarchy. He was the most
powerful monarch of his time; but his conduct was characterized by a
total want of faith, and a recklessness of principle of which he made no
scruple of boasting. He was the founder of that fearful tribunal, the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>1570. Earl <strong>Murray</strong>, regent of Scotland, shot by Hamilton of
Bothwellhaugh. The latter, after the battle of Langside hill, had been
condemned to death as a rebel, and pardoned. A part of his estate,
however, was bestowed upon one of the regent's favorites, who seized
Hamilton's house and turned his wife out into the fields naked in a cold
night, by which she became deranged. This injury induced him to seek
revenge on the regent, after which he escaped to France.</p>

<p>1722. <strong>Henri De Boulainvilliers</strong>, count of St. Saire in Normandy, died.
Having finished his studies he entered the army, which however, he soon
left to devote his attention to literature. A marked antipathy to
revelation pervades his writings, and exhibits itself in singular
contrast with a superstitious reverence for judicial astrology, and the
mystic sciences, which he cultivated with much diligence.</p>

<p>1733. <span class="allcapsc">O. S.</span> Birthday of <strong>Benjamin Lincoln</strong>, a revolutionary general, at
Hingham, Mass. Great reliance was placed in his abilities by Washington,
and many important commissions entrusted to him. In 1781 he was
appointed secretary of war, which office he held three years, and then
retired to his farm. He died 1810.</p>

<p>1761. Action between the British frigate Minerva, 22 guns, Capt. Hood,

<p>1765. The British under Capt. Byron colonized the Falkland islands.</p>

<p>1766. <strong>William Caslon</strong>, an eminent English type founder, died. He was
induced to attempt letter-cutting by a friend, and <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>such was the
perfection to which he carried the art, that the beauty of his type
exceeded all others of the day, and was sought for from other countries
on the continent. He was employed to cut characters for several
languages of Asia.</p>

<p>1772. Mrs. <strong>Clum</strong> died near Litchfield, England, aged 138. She had lived
103 years in one house.</p>

the arbitrary laws of England were attempted to be executed by force, to
repel the same by the most determined resistance.</p>

<p>1780. The British ship Culloden of 74 guns lost off Long island.</p>

<p>1789. <strong>Frances Brooke</strong> died, an English lady, remarkable for her literary
accomplishments. Her works consist of novels, periodicals, tragedies,
musical dramas, and translations.</p>

<p>1789. <strong>John Cleland</strong> died; author of the notoriously immoral romance,
<cite>Fanny Hill</cite>.</p>

<p>1790. The mutineers of the ship Bounty having arrived at Pitcairn's
island, and landed all their effects, set fire to the vessel and
destroyed every vestige that could lead to the discovery of their
retreat. The island was then divided into nine equal portions between
them, and the natives were reduced to the condition of slaves. (See <a href="#Oct_3_1793">Oct.
3</a>.)</p>

<p>1795. <strong>John Sullivan</strong>, a distinguished general in the revolutionary army,
died. He was of Irish descent, and before the revolution practiced law
in New Hampshire. He was among the first to take an active part in the
contest; resigned his seat in the first congress to enter the army; was
conspicuous at several engagements; and terminated his military career
in laying waste the country of the Six Nations, in order to put a stop
to their depredations. After the peace he filled several important state
offices.</p>

<p>1795. The French took possession of the Hague and Helvoetsluis, made 800
Englishmen prisoners, and liberated 600 Frenchmen.</p>

<p>1799. The French under Championnet entered Naples.</p>

<p>1800. A convention signed between Gen. Kleber and the grand vizier for
the evacuation of Egypt by the French troops.</p>

<p>1800. <strong>Edward Rutledge</strong>, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. He was a member of the first congress and acted a
conspicuous part during the war. While the British beleaguered
Charleston, his native city, he commanded a company of troops, and was
taken prisoner. On the restoration of peace he returned to the practice
of law, and a short time previous to his death was elected governor of
the state of South Carolina.</p>

<p>1802. <strong>Humboldt</strong> and his companions ascended Chimborazo to the height of
18,576 feet above the surface of the sea. The blood started from their
eyes, lips and gums, and they became almost torpid with cold. A narrow
deep valley prevented them from reaching the summit, which was 1344 feet
higher.</p>

<p>1806. <strong>William Pitt</strong>, second son of the earl of Chatham, died. He was born
1759, and at the age of 23 became chancellor of the exchequer and the
next year prime minister. It was during the early part of his career
that the American war was concluded. Notwithstanding the emoluments of
his offices were great, so far from acquiring wealth, he died involved.
Parliament decreed him a public funeral, and £40,000 to pay his debts.</p>

<p>1813. <strong>George Clymer</strong>, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. By the death of his parents he was left an orphan at
the age of 7 years; but he was taken care of by his uncle, who left him
a large fortune, with which to continue the business of a merchant in
Philadelphia. His services to the country during the revolution, in
raising supplies and devising ways and means to continue the struggle,
were of incalculable importance.</p>

<p>1813. Horrible massacre of the United States prisoners taken by the
British and Indians at the battle of Frenchtown the day before. The
houses in which the helpless wounded lay were set on fire, and those who
were too feeble to continue the march were shot or tomahawked on the
road. It is morally certain that the British generals Proctor and
Elliott were culpable for this wanton sacrifice of human life to satiate
the revenge of the savages.</p>

<p>1813. <strong>Robert Jamison</strong> died in South Carolina, aged 104. His eyesight,
which had failed him some years previous to his decease, returned again
just before his death in all its strength.</p>

<p>1815. Thanksgiving day in New Orleans, and a solemn <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> on account
of Jackson's victory.</p>

<p>1820. <strong>Edward</strong>, duke of Kent, died. He was the fourth son of George III.
In 1802 he was appointed governor of Gibraltar, but his rigid discipline
produced a mutiny, and he was recalled. The present queen of England is
his daughter.</p>

<p>1824. <strong>Stephen Acour Kover</strong>, an Armenian writer of distinction, died, aged
84.</p>

<p>1833. <strong>Banastre Tarleton</strong> died, aged 78. He commanded the British cavalry
in the Carolinas, in the revolution.</p>

<p>1841. <strong>Sarah Ann Davis</strong> sentenced at Philadelphia for murder; the first
capital conviction of a female in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>1844. <strong>William Gaston</strong> died at Raleigh, the capital of his native state.
The <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>prudence and energy of his mother made a disposition, naturally
volatile and irritable, become a pattern of patience and perseverance.
His speeches when a member of congress were highly finished.</p>

<p>1853. <strong>Junius Smith</strong> died, aged 74; having devoted a considerable portion
of his life to the establishment of transatlantic steam-navigation, and
the naturalization of the teaplant in the United States.</p>

people.</p>

surface of the earth was raised between three and four feet, and the
shellfish attached to the rocks died.</p>

<p>41. <strong>Caius Caligula</strong>, the Roman emperor, assassinated. He commenced his
reign with every promise of becoming a good monarch. But at the end of
eight months he was attacked with a fever, which appears to have left a
frenzy upon his mind, for his disposition was totally reversed. After
committing the most atrocious acts of cruelty and folly, he was
assassinated by a tribune as he came out of the amphitheatre, in the
29th year of his age, and the 4th of his reign.</p>

<p>76. Birthday of <strong>Publius Ælius Adrian</strong>, the Roman emperor. He was a
renowned general and great traveler; who, on a visit to Britain, built
the famous wall or rampart, which still retains his name, extending from
the mouth of the Tyne to the Solway frith, 80 miles, to prevent the
incursions of the Caledonians into England.</p>

<p>1559. <strong>Christian II</strong>, king of Denmark, died. His history affords a series
of cruelties and usurpations almost without a parallel, from 1515, when
he ascended the throne, until 1523, when he was deposed. The remainder
of his life was passed in imprisonment.</p>

<p>1709. <strong>George Rooke</strong>, an English admiral, died. He took the fortress of
Gibraltar, by surprise, 1704; since which it has continued in the hands
of the British, and is considered impregnable.</p>

<p>1727. <strong>Philip de Vendome</strong>, a French general, died. He distinguished
himself in the army of Louis XIV.</p>

revolutionary war; and was possessed of a most remarkable degree of
activity, both of body and mind, until the morning he expired.</p>

<p>1834. <strong>William Donnison</strong>, an officer of the revolution, died. He was

<p>275. <strong>Lucius Domitius Aurelianus</strong>, emperor of Rome, assassinated. He was
the son of a peasant; his mother a priestess of the Temple of the Sun.
He enlisted as a common soldier, and rose from that humble station to
the highest military offices during the reigns of Valerian and Claudius,
the latter of whom, on his death bed, recommended Aurelian to the choice
of the troops. He delivered Italy from the barbarians, and conquered the
famous Zenobia queen of Palmyra. He had planned an expedition against
Persia, and was <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>waiting in Thrace for an opportunity to cross the
straits when he fell a victim to a conspiracy.</p>

masterly manœuvre the British succeeded in obtaining it.</p>

<p>1786. <strong>Charles Price</strong>, one of the most successful counterfeiters ever
known, committed suicide in prison, London. He had continued to practice
forgeries on the Bank of England to an incredible amount during six
years, contriving all the while to elude the most cunning devices of the
police to detect him, although the notes were traced in every quarter to
have proceeded from one man, always disguised and always inaccessible.</p>

<p>1787. Battle with the insurgents under Shays, at Springfield, Mass., who

city of Bucharest, and 60 persons killed.</p>

<p>1841. The shock of an earthquake was felt in the city of New York and
vicinity to such a degree as to excite considerable alarm.</p>

<p>1843. <strong>Edward Drummund</strong>, private secretary to Sir Robert Peel, was

they not corroborated by contemporary historians.</p>

to assist the king, Louis XVI, and M. Calonne, to raise a revenue to
meet the exigencies of the times. M. Calonne presented his new plan of
reform and taxation, imposing a share of the burden upon the privileged
classes: but as the assembly was composed of these classes they could
not make up their minds to impose taxes upon themselves which had
hitherto been borne by the lower classes. The assembly was called to
help the king and his minister out of a dilemma, but plunged them deeper

<p>1820. <strong>Henry Andrews</strong>, a self-taught English mathematician, died. For more
than forty years he produced an almanac for a company of stationers
under the name of Francis Moore, physician, and astonished the simple
and ignorant by his marvelous predictions. His prophecies were as much
laughed at by himself as by the worshipful company of stationers for
whom he annually manufactured them in order to render their almanacs
salable among the ignorant, with whom a lucky hit covered a multitude of
blunders. A few years before his death he predicted that the people
would soon know better than to be influenced by the prophecies which his
employers required him to write. He did not live to see the publication
of the <cite>British Almanac</cite>, which effected the downfall of <cite>Poor Robin</cite>
(the title of one of his almanacs), which ceased to exist in 1828.</p>

<p>1823. <strong>Edward Jenner</strong> died, aged 74, celebrated for having introduced the

parliament of £20,000.</p>

resistance which he made at that place, to the British under admiral

New York 1764, and graduated at Cambridge, Mass. He was the fifth in
descent from Kilian Van Rensselaer, the original proprietor and patentee

wealth, and distinguished for his magnificent charities and Christian
virtues.</p>

island, drove off from one of the inhabitants of Warwick, 15 horses, 50

<p>1696. The Royal Sovereign burnt by accident. She was the first great
ship built in England, and became one of the best men of war in the
world. For sixty years she was so formidable to her enemies that none of
the most daring of them willingly ventured an engagement. The levies of
money for building this noble vessel caused the rebellion.</p>

<p>1733. <strong>Thomas Woolston</strong>, an English divine, died in prison. He imbibed a
fondness for allegorical interpretations of scripture from reading some
of the early writers—particularly Origen. His speculations finally led
to an indictment for blasphemy, and being unable to pay the fine
imposed, he was retained in prison. He was a learned man, but held
notions peculiar to himself, which was a high offence in those days.</p>

<p>1760. The ice carried away one of the dykes of the Rhine, in consequence
of which the neighboring country was inundated.</p>

and lost an arm at Leipsic. He made himself useful under Louis XVIII and
Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>1832. <strong>Andrew Bell</strong>, founder of the Bell or Madras system of education,
died. It has been made a subject of dispute whether Bell or Lancaster is
the progenitor of the monitorial or mutual system of instruction. In
1796 Dr. Bell returned from Madras, and submitted his system to the
public. It has since been widely diffused over the civilized world.</p>

<p>1836. <strong>Frederick David Schaeffer</strong> died, pastor of the German Lutheran
church in Philadelphia. He was born and educated in Germany, but came to

<p>1840. <strong>Isaac Chauncey</strong>, a distinguished American commodore, died at
Washington.</p>

<p>1841. <strong>McLeod</strong> arrested within the limits of the state of New York. Though

he was raised up and let down the stairs by a machine, after an illness
of some weeks, sank under his disease, and died in the 38th year of his
reign, and the 56th of his age. He repudiated his first wife 20 years
after marriage, and in the course of about ten years espoused five
others. Henry's reign was one of the most remarkable in the annals of
the kingdom. He made himself so much feared, that no English king had
fewer checks to his power. No hand less strong than his could have
snapped the chain which bound the nation to papacy, and have resisted
successfully the power and influence of the pope.</p>

<p>1588. <strong>Thomas Carn</strong> died in London, aged 207; an instance of longevity
exceeding any other on modern record, but well authenticated in the

when the Seicks gave a signal for a general charge, and agreeable to
their mode in close combat, flung away their turbans, let loose their
hair, put their beards in their mouths, and dashed into the midst of the
Huddalah army. The two armies continued engaged in close combat four
hours, when Zemaun's troops gave way, and were pursued to the very gates
of Lahore. The loss of the Seicks was 15,000; that of the Shah 20,000
killed.</p>

of the <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>court of admiralty in England, thirty years with distinguished

<p>1842. The first stone of the Anglican cathedral at Jerusalem laid, at a

America burst into an open flame, and an empire was lost to the British

in the 82d year of his age and the 59th of his reign.</p>

the English pretender, whence she derived the title of countess of
Albany. They resided at Rome, and had a little court, and were addressed
as king and queen. The connection, however, was an unhappy one, and to
escape from the barbarity of her husband she retired to a convent, and
afterwards went to France. On the death of Charles, 1788, she returned
to Italy. She was then secretly married to Alfieri, the poet; the French
court conferred on her an annuity of 60,000 livres. Alfieri confesses

first consul.</p>

starve the clergy.</p>

<p>1788. <strong>Charles Stuart</strong>, the pretender to the throne of England, died at
Rome. He was the grandson of James II, born at Rome 1720. In 1745 he
landed in Scotland, with only seven companions, and marched south
gaining strength and carrying every thing before him till he arrived
within 100 miles of London. Here his career was arrested, and the battle
of Culloden decided his fate. He wandered about the wilds of Scotland
five months, often without food, and the price of £30,000 set upon his
head. He finally escaped in a French vessel, and ended his days in
dissipation.</p>

<p>1795. The assembly of the states of Holland passed at the Hague the

and the flag stuck up; about midnight a party of Indians fired on them,
wounded the doctor in the foot, killed and scalped his companion, Mr.
Lamont, and stripped him, they took the money, horse, blankets, &amp;c., and
compelled the doctor to travel 20 miles that night on foot.</p>

king of restored Greece; at which time he had not attained his 18th
year.</p>

<p>1838. <strong>Osceola</strong>, the celebrated Seminole chief, died at Charleston, S. C.,
aged 35. From a vagabond child he became the master-spirit of a long and
desperate war. He was a subtil and sagacious savage, who established
gradually and surely a resistless ascendancy over his adopted tribe, by
the daring of his deeds, the constancy of his hostility to the whites,
and the profound craft of his policy.</p>

<p>1839. <strong>James Byles</strong> died at Oyster bay, N. Y., aged 118. He was a native
of France, came to this country while a boy, <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>was a soldier under Wolfe,

118, returned, at the age of 138, so that she could thread a needle.</p>

<p>1854. The rail road track at Erie, Pa., torn up the second time by a
mob.</p>

<p>1855. The western rail roads blocked with snow, and travel almost wholly
obstructed for several days. No communication was had between St. Louis
and Chicago for eleven days. Seventeen locomotives were frozen in or
buried by the snow on the Chicago and Mississippi rail road.</p>

inquisitor-general and minister of Spain.</p>

<p>1684. <strong>Robert Leighton</strong>, a Scotch prelate, died. He for a number of years
employed his talents and influence in a vain endeavor to bring about a

preacher he was admired beyond all his contemporaries, and his works
have not yet lost their popularity.</p>

<p>1686. <strong>Francis Blondel</strong> died; eminent for his knowledge of geometry and

<p>1733. <strong>Frederick Augustus</strong>, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, died.
His court was one of the most splendid and polished in Europe, and he
filled with dignity his station among the European powers. In his

pleasure with the cares of ambition; and the restlessness of a warlike
spirit with the effeminacy of a luxurious life. Instances of his
prodigious strength are recorded, which appear almost incredible.</p>

Hancock their president.</p>

having lost 160 men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>1801. <strong>Daniel Nicholas Chodowiecki</strong>, a German painter and engraver, died.
He practiced miniature painting with great assiduity to support his
mother. His first trials at engraving excited the astonishment of

he did not engrave at least a vignette. He was universally esteemed for
his integrity.</p>

<p>1804. <strong>J. Packer</strong> died at Spinningfield, England, aged 33, weighing 29
stone.</p>

guns and 38 men; on the 26th the Hazard fell in with and took both of
them; but succeeded in bringing the Albion only into St. Mary's. The
Hazard had her first lieutenant and 6 men wounded, but she was much

the pulpit, and succeeded to his father's benefice. He established the
<cite>Morning Post</cite>, and subsequently several other papers, and manifested
his literary abilities by the production of several successful comedies.
He obtained a baronetcy, and at the time of his decease was a magistrate

said Raphael and Michael Angelo, though incomparable artists, never

sculpture he turned his attention to that art, and was sent to Rome to
study at the academy's expense. From Italy he repaired to Russia, where
he stayed two years; but not meeting with any adequate encouragement, he
returned to his own country. A colossal statue of Achilles mourning the
loss of Briseis is his masterpiece. He closed a life of arduous

England that will long attest his skill.</p>

<p>1834. <strong>Lorenzo Dow</strong> died, aged 57; an eccentric traveling preacher. He was
born in Connecticut and had a good elementary education; but in his
youth acquired vicious habits which however he overcame at about the age
of 14. At an early age he believed himself called to preach, and in
obeying the impulse he commenced a career which has probably never been
equaled; and in spite of acute bodily disease performed an amount of
labor in traveling and preaching never before known. Before he had
completed his twenty-fifth year, he once rode 1500 miles and held 184
meetings in ten weeks and two days; and about a year afterwards,
traveled 4000 miles in the southern states, constantly preaching, in
seven months, and finished his tour without stockings, shoes, or outer
garment, and almost without a horse. For several years after he traveled
from seven to ten thousand miles and held six or seven hundred meetings
annually. It is thought that during the thirty-eight years of his public
life he must have traveled two hundred thousand miles, including three
voyages to England and Ireland. During these flying journeys he
<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>constantly refused donations and contributions, except for immediate
want; and his traveling expenses exceeded his receipts more than one
half, the first eighteen years. Afterwards, however, his books became a
source of profit to him, and finally he became the maker and vender of a
<em>family medicine!</em> which was a matter of speculation purely. He was
twice married; his second wife survived him. He was familiar to every
body throughout the United States, for there were few places however
obscure which he had not visited.</p>

<p>1839. <strong>Deborah Logan</strong> died at Stanton, Pa. She was a member of the
Pennsylvania historical society, and more intimately acquainted with the
early history of that state, than any other person living.</p>

more than thirty years professor of mathematics in the royal military

long period conducted by Dr. Hutton. He published mathematics, biography
and religion.</p>

bound to France with M. de Lafayette and several French gentlemen of
distinction on board. Half the crew were concerned in it, and measures
were taken to quell it but a few hours before it was to have been

and the French. This was the first organized mutiny ever known in the
American service. The mutineers were 36 in number.</p>

<p>1781. The Americans, closely pursued by the British after the battle of
the Cowpens, crossed the Yadkin and secured their boats on the north

their cause was favored of heaven.</p>

<p>1774. <strong>Charles Marie de la Condamine</strong> died. He was possessed of a daring
spirit, which led him to enter the army. But the restoration of peace
cut off his hopes of promotion, and he traveled in Turkey and Asia. On
his return to Paris, the academy were making arrangements to send a
deputation to the equator for scientific purposes. The very desire of
being connected with so perilous an undertaking made him an astronomer.
The fatigues and hardships which he encountered in South-America, were

He died while undergoing an operation for the removal of a malady

his reputation with the learned, but contributed nothing to his support,
and he continued to struggle against poverty and oppression.</p>

<p>46 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> <strong>Marcus Cato</strong> killed himself, at the age of 48. He was a lover of
philosophy, in which he rigidly followed the doctrines of the stoics. He
was a soldier, and his first campaign was against Spartacus; afterwards
he led 1000 foot into Asia, where he was ridiculed for the small number
of his attendants, but was wholly unmoved by it. He sided with Cicero
against Catiline, and opposed Cæsar in the senate on that occasion. He
endeavored to bring about a reconciliation between Cæsar and Pompey, but
finding it in vain, sided with the latter. When Pompey was slain he fled
to Utica, and Cæsar pursuing him, he advised his friends to be gone, and
his son to trust to Cæsar's clemency; then lay down upon his bed, read
Plato on the immortality of the soul twice over, and rose and thrust
his own sword through his body.</p>

two brothers, to be enjoyed by them during 30 years, at the expiration
of which time he expected to return to life, when the estate was to be
given up to him again. In order to his convenience on his reappearance,
he ordered his coffin to be placed on a beam in the barn, with the key
enclosed, that he might liberate himself. Four days grace being allowed
him for his resurrection, beyond the time specified in the will, and not

an enlarged view of the principles of Hoffman.</p>

prudence, and gained the confidence of the people.</p>

bold and crafty rebel against the Porte; an intelligent and active
governor of his province; as a warrior, decided and able; as a man, a
very fiend. His early life was unfortunate, but his extraordinary
strength of mind, which shrank from no danger or crime, united to great
address, raised him to princely independence. His enormities at length
attracted the wrath of the sultan. Finding it vain to withstand so
powerful a foe, he sued for pardon, gave up his fortress, and was
treacherously cut down, with six of his companions.</p>

<p>1823. Yates county, New York, erected.</p>

that tribunal. When the fortunes of the Bonapartes declined, he was
banished from his country, and lived in France in indigence, supporting
himself by teaching Spanish in the boarding schools; but the university
at last forbid him that means of support. The rage of his enemies was
raised to the highest pitch by the publication of his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Portraits
Politiques des Papes</cite>, and the old man was ordered in the middle of
winter to leave Paris in three days, and France in the shortest possible
time. He was not allowed to rest one day, and died exhausted, a victim
to the persecutions of the 19th century, a few days after his arrival in
Madrid.</p>

time of the resumption of specie payments on the 15th January, paid out
an amount little if at all short of six millions of dollars in coin or
specie funds, again suspended specie payments. The exhibition of its
affairs, which soon followed, were so unfavorable as to cause great
surprise. The suspension was followed by that of nearly all the banks
south and west of New York and New England.</p>

<p>1851. <strong>John Pye Smith</strong> died, aged 77; a religious controversial author of
note, and nearly half a century principal of a dissenting college in
England.</p>

father he was a refugee at the Hague, on which he immediately assumed
the royal title. In 1660 he entered London amidst the universal
acclamations of the people. He was a confirmed sensualist and
voluptuary, says Lardner, and owing to the example of him and his court,
his reign was the era of the most dissolute manners that ever prevailed
in England. His career was terminated by a fit of apoplexy, at the age
of 55. It was during this reign that the great plague and the great fire
of London occurred. He was the twenty-sixth king of England.</p>

containing 25,000 inhabitants, was reduced to a heap of ruins, not a

fisherman. He built St. Peter's at Rome, to procure means for which he
ordered the sale of indulgences, which was one of the immediate causes
of the reformation; so that it may be said without paradox, that St.
Peter's is the great monument of protestantism. He is considered one of
the most immoral of the popes, though a generous patron of the polite
arts.</p>

<p>1595. <strong>Robert Southwell</strong>, called sometimes the English Jesuit, died. He
was esteemed no inferior poet in his day.</p>

<p>1633. Order of the privy council to stay several ships in the Thames,
ready to sail for New England with passengers and provisions. The
jealousy of the government was early directed towards the infant colony
of Massachusetts. It was observed by one of the kings, that the <em>wheat</em>
of the population was sifting across the Atlantic. These orders were
ineffectual, for great numbers continued to emigrate, and scarce a
vessel arrived in the colony that was not crowded with passengers.</p>

<p>1660. The secluded members of the long parliament again took their seats
and voted Monk to be general of the English, Scotch and Irish forces.</p>

the town of Medfield, Mass., killed 18 men, women and children, and

of Virginia: "John Buckner called before the Ld. Culpepper and his

anything hereafter until his majesty's pleasure shall be known."</p>

French embarked a few days after, and meeting with a British squadron,
an action ensued in which Thourot and 300 of his men were killed.</p>

<p>1792. <strong>Jacob Schnebbelie</strong> died at London. From the profession of a Swiss
confectioner, he rose to be one of the best draughtsmen in England, but
too intense application to his studies hastened his death.</p>

<p>1796. Field Marshal <strong>Clairfait</strong>, the Austrian general, resigned, and was
succeeded by the Archduke Charles, for whom a new rank was created, that
of field-marshal-general, being the highest military rank in the empire.</p>

<p>1824. <strong>Eugene de Beauharnais</strong>, duke of Leuchtenberg, died. He was the son
of Josephine Tacher de la Pagerie, afterwards wife of Napoleon. He
distinguished himself in the army, and was made viceroy of Italy, the
government of which he managed with great prudence. With the fall of
Napoleon he lost his titles and offices, but was in a measure
indemnified by the articles of Fontainbleau, the congress of Vienna, and
the duke of Bavaria. Under a simple exterior prince Eugene concealed a
noble character and great talents.</p>

celebrated preacher.</p>

wisdom and energy of his government.</p>

<p>1630. The first day of public thanksgiving in Massachusetts. The day
had been appointed, for a general fast. No ship had arrived in a great
length of time, and their stock of provisions was nearly exhausted. At
this critical moment a vessel arrived from England laden with
provisions; and they immediately changed the day of public fasting into
one of public feasting. And it is quite probable that the day was
observed with something more than an outward show of thanksgiving on
that occasion.</p>

<p>1644. <strong>Charles I</strong>, having summoned a royal parliament, they met this day
at Oxford to the number of 44 lords and 118 commoners; the session was
opened with a speech from the king.</p>

<p>1674. <strong>Jean Chapelain</strong>, died. He attracted the notice of Cardinal
Richelieu by a preface which he wrote for the <cite>Adonis</cite> of Marini.
Chapelain was talented and learned, obsequious and discreet, and these
made his fortune, for he could be of service to the cardinal, who had
the weakness to set up for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</i>. He became one of the first
members of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Academie Francaise</i>, received a large pension, and
became the oracle of the poets of the time, and was universally
esteemed. It would have been better if he himself had not set up for a
poet. In 1630 he commenced an epic, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Pucelle</cite>. It was announced
twenty years before its appearance, and the public expectation was
greatly disappointed; it soon became an object of ridicule.</p>

the 20th, on which day Dr. Brattle was buried, and many who attended his

years <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>of age, who was recorded in the public prints as the first martyr

<p>1525. Battle of Pavia in Italy. The imperialists under Bourbon, Pescara

Ensign Daniel Fisher, and other English at Dedham, their associates and
successors," by Chauk alias Chague, the sachem of Pocomptuck, and his
brother Wassahoale, and witnessed by Wequonnock. It reserves to the
Indians the right of fishing in the rivers, hunting wild animals, and
gathering nuts. It is capable of proof, that the early settlers in New
England, as well as New York, made it a matter of course to purchase the
lands upon which they settled, in nearly all instances, and at prices
which were considered a fair equivalent at the time by the Indians. It
may be mentioned as a matter of curiosity, that the salary of the first
minister settled at this place was £60, to be paid in wheat at 3s. 6d.,
peas at 2s. 6d., corn at 2s. per bushel, and salted pork at 2½d. per

<p>1676. Attack on Medfield, Mass., by a party of about 300 Indians. The
loss of Lancaster, a short time previous, had put the neighboring towns
on their guard, and Medfield had obtained a small garrison of soldiers
for greater security, although within 22 miles of Boston. The Indians
during the night had secreted themselves, according to custom, under the
fences and behind trees about the villages, so that the people were shot
down as they came out of their doors and their houses immediately set on
fire. The soldiers being lodged in different parts of the town, could
not get together until about 50 buildings were on fire. Some were killed
as they attempted to pass to their neighbors for shelter, and in some
instances, the husband flying with one child and the wife with another,
one of them fell into the hands of the savages or was killed, while the
other escaped. Two or three discharges of a field piece put the whole
horde to flight, who as they passed the river fired the bridge to
prevent pursuit. Loss 18 killed, and many wounded and carried away for
torture. (Holmes says Feb. 21.)</p>

Canada, made an attack upon this place, which was the northern frontier
on Connecticut river. A watch had patrolled the streets until about two
hours before day, when he incautiously fell asleep, and the snow was of
such depth as to admit of an entrance over the pickets of the fort. The
whole settlement was burnt with the exception of one house, which was
standing until quite recently; 47 were slain, 112 carried into
captivity, including among the latter, the Rev. John Williams and his
family. Of the captives, 17 died or were killed on the march; 57 were
redeemed, among whom were the minister and his family (his wife was
killed soon after the capture), except one daughter who could not be

it is said, still hangs in an Indian church at St. Regis.</p>

<p>1744. <strong>John Theophilus Desaguliers</strong> died. He was the son of a French
protestant clergyman, who resided in England. Having been educated for
the ministry, he settled in London; there he acquired a turn for natural
philosophy, and was the first person who lectured on experimental
philosophy in the metropolis. He was a man of rare ability, and his
income enabled him to keep an equipage. His coachman, Erasmus King, from
the force of example, became a kind of rival to the doctor; for he also
undertook to read lectures, and exhibit experiments in natural
philosophy. The terms of admission to the <em>lyceum</em> of the latter
philosopher were in proportion to the humble station he had filled.</p>

attributed to the circumstance of a club of kindred spirits, who used to
meet on week days and read classics, and on Sundays divinity, but
shortly their meetings became exclusively religious. This society
consisted of fifteen members, who from the strictness of their manners
and deportment, obtained the name of <em>Methodists</em>, an appellation which
they sanctioned and retained. He visited America, and afterwards
Germany, and on his return commenced the systematic labors by which he
became the founder of a numerous religious sect. He joined with

George Byng, and rose to the same rank himself. His attempt to relieve
Fort St. Philip in Minorca proving abortive, when blockaded by a French
fleet under La Glassionere, and his hesitation in engaging the enemy
when a bold attack might perhaps have gained him the victory, excited
the clamor of the nation against him, and he was doomed to meet the
penalty of cowardice.</p>

<p>1758. <strong>General Wade</strong> died. In 1715, he commanded against the forces of the
pretender to the throne, and remained in Scotland as commander-in-chief
after the war was ended. It was during this period that he cut the
celebrated military road through the highlands, which facilitated the
improvement and civilization of the country more than all the measures
resorted to before the reign of George I. It was he who introduced the
bill into parliament which disarmed and changed the dress of the
highlanders.</p>

and formed the resolution of writing a great epic poem. In 1745 he
studied theology at Jena, where he commenced in solitude the first canto
of <cite>The Messiah</cite>. This work he finished about 1790. It procured him
great celebrity in the north of Europe, so that he was received with
great respect and veneration wherever he went. His funeral was attended
by the principal men of Hamburg, in 126 carriages.</p>

<p>1813. Delaware river blockaded by the British ships Poictiers,

<p>1649. An army of 1000 Iroquois armed with guns fell upon the Huron
village at the eastern extremity of the lake, and nearly massacred the
entire population. The Hurons defended themselves bravely, but were

Reynolds.</p>

<p>1810. On a pane of glass at an inn near London, under this date, is the
following inscription. "Thomas Mount Jones dined here, ate six pounds
bacon, and drank nineteen pots beer." It is a question for discussion,
whether in this frail memorial, the love of distinction and desire for
fame were not as great as the love of brutal gluttony.</p>

<p>1813. Captain <strong>Berresford</strong> of the British ship Poictiers, 74 guns,

ancestors in several generations were by profession shipmasters.
Notwithstanding the very limited advantages of his education, and his
laborious employment through life for the support of his family, yet by
his extraordinary genius and economy of time, he made great acquisitions
in learning and science, gained most of the languages, and made himself
the most eminent mathematician and astronomer that America has produced.
He published the <cite>Practical Navigator</cite>, a standard book; but the great
work on which his fame will rest, is the copious and profound commentary
upon the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mechanique Celeste</cite> of La Place, of which he made the first
entire translation, and published at his own expense in 4 vols. quarto;
saying that he preferred spending a thousand dollars a year in that way

in their houses.</p>

possessed some good qualities, and formed many wise regulations in civil
and ecclesiastical affairs.</p>

Jonson, and his works have been several times reprinted.</p>

States.</p>

joyfully received as a deliverer. The British left 250 cannon and 25,000
bushels of wheat.</p>

<p>1781. <strong>Johannes Evald</strong> died: the most distinguished poetical genius of
Denmark, in the eighteenth century. Being left to his own reading by his
tutor, his imagination was captivated with <cite>Tom Jones</cite> and <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite>. Proposing to himself the latter hero for a model, he eloped at
the age of thirteen with a view of proceeding to Batavia, but was
overtaken, and his project frustrated. He next conceived the scheme of
entering the Prussian army, and enlisted at Magdeburg; but being
received only as a foot soldier, instead of a hussar, he deserted to the
Austrians. On quitting the army he devoted himself to the study of
theology, but having suddenly become violently enamored with a young
lady, who regardless of his passion, bestowed her hand on another, a
permanent melancholy settled upon his mind, and under this influence he
took up his pen. His first work <cite>Fortune's Temple</cite>, a vision, at once
stamped his reputation. In 1772 he executed his literary
chef-d'œuvre, <cite>Balder's Död</cite>, a drama of extraordinary poetical
beauty, and greatly superior to anything which had then appeared in the
Danish language. His after life was embittered by poverty and sickness;
and it was under the hospitable roof of Madame Skou that he breathed his
last, after having been confined to his bed or armchair two years, and
almost deprived of the use of his limbs.</p>

<p>1782. <strong>Daniel Bernouilli</strong>, a German philosopher, died. He studied medicine
as a profession, but was at the same time engaged with mathematics. At
the age of twenty-four, he was offered the presidency of an academy at
Genoa, but gave the preference to an invitation from St. Petersburgh. He
returned to Basle in 1733, <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>where he spent the remainder of his days, so
much respected by the inhabitants, that to bow to Daniel Bernouilli,
when met in the street, was one of the first lessons which every father
gave his children.</p>

<p>1790. The government of France issued assignats to the amount of
170,000,000 francs. This system of assignats, while it gave more
strength to the public, yet was the source of more private suffering
than any other measure during the French revolution.</p>

<p>1793. Battle of Neerwinden, or Linden, between the French under
Dumourier, and the Austrians under Coburg and Clarifayt. Dumourier was

December, 1741, <em>to play a comic cast of characters</em> in the great
theatre, the world; for many of which he was <em>prompted</em> by nature to
excel. The <em>season</em> being ended, his <em>benefit</em> over, the charges all
paid, his account closed, he made his <em>exit</em> in the <em>tragedy of Death</em>
on the 17th of March, 1798, in assurance of being called once more to
<em>rehearsal</em>, where he hopes to find his <em>forfeits</em> all cleared, his
<em>cast of parts</em> bettered, and his situation made agreeable by him who
paid the great <em>stock debt</em>, for the love of <em>performers</em> in general."</p>

<p>1799. The French army arrived before St. Jean d'Acre, and to their no
small chagrin and astonishment, beheld the town prepared for a siege,

explosion off Leghorn. More than 800 persons perished with her.</p>

<p>1806. <strong>William Rowley</strong>, an eminent British physician, died. He was a man
of great skill and experience in his profession, and his benevolence and
humanity were conspicuous; yet was he one of the most obstinate
opponents to the introduction of vaccination as a preventive of small
pox that ever impeded the might of his authority to that experiment.</p>

<p>1808. Rupture of the negotiation at Washington between the British
minister and the American government.</p>

<p>979. <strong>Edward the Martyr</strong>, died. He was the son of Edgar, and succeeded his
father as king of England at the age of 15. The young king paid little
attention to any thing but the chase; and hunting one day, he got
separated from his attendants, and repaired to Corfe castle, where his
step-mother, Elfrida, resided. Having procured a draught of liquor, he
was drinking it on horseback, when one of Elfrida's servants gave him a
deep stab behind. He immediately spurred his horse, but fainting from
loss of blood, was dragged in the stirrup till he died. The pity caused
by his innocence and misfortune induced the people to regard him as a
martyr.</p>

<p>1350. In the national roll of accounts for glazing St. Stephen's chapel,

small pox upon her own son at Belgrade, in Turkey. It was tried in

have destroyed the invading Ethiopian army, and thus terminated in 360,
what is denominated <em>the war of the elephant</em>.</p>

said to have been the inventor of bombs; while Strada in his account of
the wars of the Low Countries, attributes the invention a few days
before this siege to an inhabitant of the town of Venloo, and that the
people of the city, wishing to exhibit it in presence of the duke of
Cleves, discharged a bomb, which falling on one of the houses, set fire

proclaimed queen, at the age of twenty-five, and held the sceptre

prosperity for England. Her treatment of the queen of Scots can never be

her reign and the strength of mind displayed in the conduct of the
government overbalance those weaknesses which few crowned heads are
devoid of.</p>

<p>1773. <strong>Philip Dormer Stanhope</strong>, earl of Chesterfield, died, aged 79. He
was one of the most celebrated wits of his age, an eminent statesman,
political, epistolatory and miscellaneous writer. His <cite>Letters</cite>,

scholar; but the critical reader will find that they insidiously
inculcate the loosest principles.</p>

the 2d to the 14th September, 1752, should be omitted, so that the 3d of

last.</p>

king was getting into his carriage at Versailles, surrounded by his
train, Damiens stabbed him in the right side with a knife. He was
seized, tried and condemned <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>to a death of torture. Being drawn on a
sledge to the Place de Greve, he there had the flesh of his thighs and

about this event; the authority from which it is derived stating that he
was the inventor of the guillotine. (See <a href="#Mar_20_1792">March 20</a>, and <a href="#April_25_1792">April 25, 1792</a>;

York, who won the day, made a triumphal entry into York, where he
ordered the death of several prisoners, while Henry who lost his crown,
escaped with difficulty to the borders.</p>

<p>1562. <strong>Philip II</strong> of Spain and the Netherlands to prevent the circulation

being concealed in a mill pond. The town did not recover from this
disaster in more than sixty years.</p>

<p>1689. <strong>Theophilus Bonet</strong>, a noted Swiss physician, died. He spent several
years at the best universities of Europe, in the study of his
profession, and became eminently successful. He published several
medical treatises in his old age, valuable in their day, for the facts
and observations which they contained.</p>

<p>1710. <strong>Henry Basnage</strong>, a French lawyer, died at the Hague. He was a
member of the parliament of Rouen, who upon the proscription of the

a congregation of presbyterians; but becoming an Arian was expelled from

<p>1730. <strong>Vincent Houdry</strong>, a French Jesuit, died, aged 99. He was an eloquent
preacher, and his writings comprise about 30 vols. His last moments were
embittered by the reflection that he could not be permitted to reach his
100th year!</p>

<p>1751. <strong>Thomas Coram</strong>, projector of the foundling hospital, died. He was
captain of a colonial trading vessel, and was prompted to this
charitable project, by frequently seeing children exposed in the streets
of London by the cruelty of their parents. He persevered in this humane
design 17 years, and at last obtained a charter by his sole application.
He was accustomed to spend so much of his time and money in charitable
services, that in his old age he was dependent upon the charities of
others, when his principal benefactor was the prince of Wales.</p>

<p>1772. <strong>Emanuel Swedenborg</strong>, founder of the New-Jerusalem church, died in
London, aged 84. His father was a Swedish Lutheran bishop, and the son
received a scientific education, and became eminent as a mathematical
and philosophical writer, was ennobled, and shared the favor of the
king. From the pursuit of philosophy he subsequently turned his
attention to heavenly things, and became equally celebrated for his
mystical reveries. His followers have multiplied in Europe and America
since his death.</p>

<p>1792. <strong>Gustavus III</strong>, king of Sweden, died. He succeeded to the throne
1771. His reign was a turbulent one, in which all the arts and
stratagems to which he was obliged to resort, scarcely secured him in
power. He formed a plan for uniting Sweden, Russia, Prussia and Austria,
with himself at the head of the confederacy. While he was maturing his
plans, a plot was formed among his nobility for assassinating him. A
masquerade at Stockholm was chosen for the perpetration of the deed. He
was shot in the back by Ankerstroom, a disbanded officer.</p>

<p>1796. <strong>La Cherette</strong> was executed; this closed the Vendean or civil war at

made its appearance at Teheran. It consisted of two closely written, and
lithographed pages, one devoted to oriental, the other to foreign
intelligence. Its conductor had been an envoy to London, whence he
carried home with him and executed the idea of a newspaper—the most
efficient missionary for the spread of civilization and intelligence the
world has ever known.</p>

<p>1844. <strong>E. Pendleton Kennedy</strong>, of the United States navy and commander of
the battle ship Pennsylvania, died at Norfolk, Va.</p>

<p>1848. <strong>John Jacob Astor</strong>, founder of the Astor library, died in New York,
aged 80. He was a native of Germany, and during a residence of nearly 60
years in America, amassed a fortune of about twenty millions of dollars.
He landed in this country with a trifling sum in his pocket, and early
commenced business as a trader in fur, and when the state of New York
was a wilderness, made frequent voyages up the Mohawk, to trade with the
Indians. As his wealth increased, he enlarged his business until by the
formation of the American Fur Company, he was a competitor with the
great capitalists of Europe, the proprietor of the North Western and
Canadian fur companies. Such was his enterprise, that he extended his
business to the mouth of the Columbia river and formed the first fur
establishment there, known as Astoria. Several expensive expeditions
were fitted out by him, of overland journeys, to the Pacific, some of
which were executed by individuals with great suffering. For many years
previous to the war of 1812, and subsequently, Mr. Astor was extensively
engaged in the Canton trade, and during the war was so fortunate that
several of his ships arrived here with valuable cargoes in safety. The
profits on those ships were enormous. Mr. Astor made large investments
in American stocks, which he purchased during the war with Great
Britain, at sixty to seventy cents on the dollar, and which after the
peace, went up to twenty per cent. above par. His great estate, however,
accumulated more from the purchase of real estate, than from any other
source.</p>

<p>1849. The Lahore war being finished, the Punjaub was formally annexed to
the British crown.</p>

an obscure family, and rose by his own merits. He was placed at the head

virtues nor his services could shield him from the malice of his
enemies, and he was condemned on a false accusation of treason.</p>

the first college in the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>1601. <strong>Henry Cuffee</strong>, celebrated for his wit, learning and misfortunes,

<p>1612. <strong>John Wower</strong>, a distinguished German politician and literary
character, died at Gottorp.</p>

<p>1621. <strong>John King</strong>, an English prelate, died. He was chaplain to Queen

due to the soldiery, many of them having twelve months' pay due.</p>

in his researches, and acquired the old Gaelic, Irish, Scotch, Danish,
Gothic, Saxon, and other northern dialects, that he might with greater
accuracy and success develop the records of ancient times. He published
a Saxon dictionary and some other works.</p>

<p>1707. <strong>Sebastian le Prestre</strong>, seigneur de Vauban, a celebrated French
engineer, died. He was taken prisoner in the service of Spain, and
persuaded to enter the French army, in which he distinguished himself by
a most unexampled career. During his life he had been engaged in 140
actions, conducted 53 sieges, assisted in repairing 300 ancient
citadels, and erected 33 new ones. His publications were principally on
fortifications, and he left 12 large volumes in manuscript, containing
observations, thoughts, &amp;c., which he called his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oisivétés</i>
(idlenesses).</p>

<p>1756. <strong>Stephen Duck</strong>, an English poet, committed suicide. He was a
persevering character, entirely self taught, and his poems were above
mediocrity. The queen bestowed upon him a pension, which enabled him to
take orders, and he obtained "a living;" in which office he sustained
himself with credit. Notwithstanding his good fortune, his spirits
became depressed, and he was led to cut short his existence by throwing
himself into the Thames.</p>

the second mutiny in the service, the first having occurred on the same
vessel, two years before (see <a href="#Feb_3_1779">Feb. 3d</a>). The third was seasonably
disclosed on board the Somers in 1842.</p>

<p>1783. <strong>William Hunter</strong>, an eminent British anatomist, died. He was
educated at the University of Glasgow, and in 1746 established himself
in London as a teacher of anatomy, where he distinguished himself; and
his works on medical subjects, which appeared at short intervals, added
to his reputation. He built an anatomical theatre and museum, and
ultimately collected there a library of Greek and Roman classics, and a
valuable cabinet of medals, now deposited in the university of Glasgow.</p>

<p>32 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> <strong>Titus Pomponius Atticus</strong>, a distinguished Roman, died. He
understood the art of conducting himself so well, that amidst the civil
wars and party strife of the time in which he lived, he preserved the

himself of a million of peaceable and useful artists; a loss which the
country has never recovered from.</p>

<p>1631. <strong>John Donne</strong>, an English poet and divine, died. He embraced
protestantism at an early age, which together with his shining talents,

Deum</i> is attributed to him.</p>

<p>1638. Massachusetts patent demanded. A quo warranto having been brought
by the attorney general of England against the governor and corporation
of Massachusetts, and judgment given that the liberties and franchises
should be seized into the king's hand, the council made an order
requiring that the charter should be returned by the next ship.
Arbitrary measures were pursued in reply to the petitions of the colony,
and 8 ships prepared to sail for New England were detained in the Thames
by order of the privy council. By this order, Oliver Cromwell, Arthur
Hazelrig, John Hambden and other malcontents, were forcibly prevented

this high-handed measure he was detaining the very men who were destined
to overturn his throne, and terminate his career by a violent death.</p>

<p>1643. <strong>Simon Episcopius</strong>, an able Dutch divine, died. He embraced the
doctrines of Arminius in relation to predestination, which exposed him
to much persecution and obloquy, and finally led to his banishment from
the commonwealth: he afterwards was permitted to return, and became
minister of the remonstrant church. His death happening at the moment of
an eclipse of the moon, was considered as an emblem of the departure of
the brightest ornament of the church.</p>

<p>1656. <strong>Andrew Rivinus</strong>, (alias Barchmann) a Saxon physician, died. He

by the English booksellers to undertake the compilation of an English
and Latin dictionary, on the plan of Faber's <cite>Thesaurus</cite>. The task
proved to be more difficult than had been anticipated, and was not
completed till 1736.</p>

<p>1747. Number Four (Charlestown, N. H.) attacked by a large body of
French and Indians under M. Debeline, and gallantly defended by 30 men,
under major Stevens. The enemy kept up a brisk assault night and day;
when, on the third day, being in a starving condition, and finding it
impracticable to force or persuade a surrender, they retired and were
seen no more. This was considered one of the most chivalrous feats of
the time.</p>

<p>1764. <strong>Michael Lomonozof</strong>, a Russian poet, died. From the occupation of a
fishmonger he rose to be the "father of Russian poetry," and a
philosopher of no mean pretensions. He published a history of the
Russian sovereigns, and an ancient history of Russia, from the origin of
the nation. His odes are greatly admired for the originality of
invention, sublimity of sentiment, and energy of language.</p>

<p>1769. <strong>Hyder Ally</strong>, the adventurous East India chief, compelled the
English to form a treaty with him.</p>

<p>1770. <strong>James Parsons</strong>, an eminent English physician, died. He was the
correspondent of Buffon and other learned characters on the continent,
and an able writer on physic, anatomy, natural history, antiquities,
language, and the fine arts.</p>

<p>1774. <strong>Oliver Goldsmith</strong> died, aged 46. He received a partial education at
Dublin college, after which he strayed from home, and making a tour on
the continent, afoot and alone, with a flute in his hand, fixed himself,
on his return, in London, as a <em>builder of books</em>. The details of his
life are interesting, chequered as they are with <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>vicissitudes. As a
bookseller's hack he was particularly successful; but the liberality of
his disposition and want of economy, contributed to keep him in want,
and sometimes brought him to starvation. He died about £2,000 in debt.
His works, though most of them were produced on the spur of the moment,
to procure the necessaries of life, are still found in almost every
library.</p>

<p>1777. <strong>John Swinton</strong>, an English antiquary, died. His literary

the spot.</p>

<p>1795. <strong>Barrere</strong> a lawyer, <strong>Varennes</strong> a monk, <strong>Collot de Herbois</strong> a comedian,
and <strong>Vadier</strong> a counsellor, members of the French convention, sentenced by
a decree of that body to be transported to Guiana. Barrere was president
of the convention, and as such passed sentence of death upon the king;
and they all voted for the king's death.</p>

<p>1799. Battle of Tauffers and St. Marie, in Germany. The French under
Jourdan lost upwards of 4,000 men, and fell back to the heights of
Villengen.</p>

<p>1802. <strong>Lloyd Kenyon</strong>, an English judge, died. He filled the offices
entrusted to him with distinguished integrity, and to him England is
indebted for much of that reform which has been introduced into the
practice of the law.</p>

<p><a name="Apr_4_1807" id="Apr_4_1807"></a>1807. <strong>Joseph Jerome la Francais de Lalande</strong> died at Paris, aged 70. He
received a minute religious education, and displayed his abilities while
quite young by his sermons and mystical romances. His attention was
first drawn to astronomy by the remarkable comet of 1744; and he pursued
the study with so great success that he was sent to Berlin by the
academy at the age of 19, to make some observations on the moon's

in Boston, 1749, served an apprenticeship of 11 years, and commenced
business at a very early age at Newburyport. In 1770 he printed the

of the skirmishers on the plains of Lexington. A few days after that
affair he removed his paper to Worcester; and gradually established
presses and book-stores in different parts of the Union, to the number

was born in London, 1525, and initiated by his father into all the
mysteries of tailoring as practiced at that period. But he discovered a
penchant for musty relics and antiquarian lumber, and finally quitted
his business to compose a history of England. He at length got together
such a medley of antique and diabolical books and parchments, that he
became suspected of some heretical designs against religion, so that the
bishop of London ordered an investigation of his library. He published
<cite>A Summarie of the Englyshe Chronicles</cite>, and in 1598 a <cite>Survey of
London</cite>, on which he was long employed, and which has been often
reprinted. He was reduced to live by charity, and at length fell a
victim to poverty and disease. His labors formed a rich legacy to future
historians.</p>

He conducted before the revolution as an able and upright officer; but

<p>1786. The celebrated catacombs of Paris consecrated, with great
solemnity. They lie under a part of the city which was undermined some
centuries ago, to furnish stone for the ancient edifices of Paris, and
at length became closed up. This cemetery had been used more than a
thousand years by twenty parishes, and it is estimated that more than
three millions of people had been inhumed within its inclosures. In
process of time, as the city extended, palaces and churches were built
over the subterranean caverns, and were in imminent danger of sinking
into the pit below, before it was again discovered. The mighty city of
Paris had until now but one burial place, where a pit was dug, and the
bodies laid side by side, without any earth being put over them, till
the first tier was full; then a thin layer of earth covered them, and
another tier of dead came on; thus by layer upon layer, and dead upon
dead, the hole was filled up. These pits were emptied every thirty or
forty years to receive new tenants. The last grave digger, Francis
Pontraci, had by his own register, in less than thirty years, inhumed
more than 90,000 bodies in that ground. The great increase of burials
rendered the cemetery still more inconvenient, and it was at last
happily thought of converting the quarries under the city into a
receptacle for the dead.</p>

greatest difficulty that he got it back again, by calling in the troops
of the Moors; and the excommunication of the pope.</p>

<p>1480. <strong>William Caxton</strong>, the first English printer, finished the
translation of <cite>Ovid's Metamorphoses</cite>, as we learn from his own

peasant, while hunting. A shrub which he had laid hold of to support
himself, was torn up by the roots, and disclosed to the hunter a rich
mass of silver. The population of the city increased so rapidly that in
1611, a little more than half a century afterwards, there were 160,000

present less than 100 mines worked, and these conducted with great
ignorance and disadvantage.</p>

1812, aged 115, at Richmond, Galway county, Ireland. It is said that at
the time of her death she could read and sew without spectacles, and

years, had a blooming complexion, her eyes animated and lively, and
walked occasionally a distance of two miles to church.</p>

<p>1809. Battle of Eckmuhl, in which Bonaparte, having routed one division
of the Austrian army two days in succession, executed a variety of
movements, considered as among the most admirable displays of his
science, by which he brought the whole of his force upon the army of the
archduke Charles, which he had concentrated at Eckmuhl. The battle is
said to have been one of the most splendid which the art of war could
display. The Austrian army, of upwards of 100,000 men, were dispossessed
of all their positions, by the combined attack of the French, whose
divisions appeared on the field, each in its due place and order, as
regularly as the movements of the various pieces in the game of chess.
The battle commenced at two in the afternoon and continued till
nightfall. It resulted in the complete overthrow of the Austrians; all
their wounded, a great part of their artillery, fifteen stands of
colors, and 20,000 prisoners, remained in the power of the French to
which their loss in the field may be added. Their retreat was also
attended with corresponding loss.</p>

<p>1826. Missolonghi taken by the Turks. It had been besieged several
months, and was reduced to a heap of ruins by continued bombardments.

heavy tribute which he paid the Danes, called <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">Danegelt</i>, he caused them
to be put to death; whereupon England was invaded by Sweyn, and Ethelred
obliged to fly to Normandy, where he remained till Sweyn's death.</p>

<p>1408. The heroic earl of Warwick, <strong>Richard Beauchamp</strong>, on his way to the

English knight cleaved with his battleaxe.</p>

<p>1500. Brazil discovered by <strong>Pedro Alvarez Cabral</strong>, a Portuguese
adventurer; who immediately sent home a ship with the intelligence, and
the king took possession of it. But as the pope had given all the
western infidels to the Spaniards, it is probable a great deal of
trouble would have arisen out of the case, had not the two monarchs been
kinsmen and friends.</p>

<p>1547. Battle of Mulhausen, in which the emperor Charles V defeated the
Saxons, who lost 1200 killed, and the elector was wounded and taken

of great eloquence and extensive learning.</p>

<p>1616. <strong>William Shakspeare</strong>, the English dramatist, died, aged 52. His
history is shrouded in obscurity; but the success of his dramas, with
the sobriety and moderation of his views, enabled him to retire early
with a competence. The writings of this great poet of nature are found
in the libraries of the greatest foes of the drama. This is also the
anniversary of his birthday, 1564.</p>

<p>1616. <strong>Michael de Cervantes Saavedra</strong>, the Spanish novelist, died, aged
67. His life was attended with poverty and misfortune. The immortal <cite>Don

in the government of the Low Countries, added to his dominions by
conquest, and was considered the ablest general of his time.</p>

<p>1662. Charter of Connecticut granted, with ample privileges, by Charles
II. John Winthrop was appointed governor until a new election should be
made. The colony of New Haven was included in the charter, but did not
consent to be united with the other colonies under one government. The
fact was, they considered their civil and religious code rather superior
to any thing else of the kind in the world, and were exceedingly jealous
of contamination.</p>

<p>1676. Engagement off Aosta, in Sicily, between the French fleet under
admiral du Quesne, and the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter, who was mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>1709. The first number of the <cite>Tatler</cite> was published by Steele, Addison
and Swift.</p>

distinguished himself by many learned works, which show a high degree of
erudition and a liberal spirit.</p>

<p>1740. <strong>Thomas Tickell</strong>, an English poet, died. He was the friend of
Addison whose works he published, and translated the Iliad in opposition
to Pope.</p>

<p>1750. <strong>Andrew Baxter</strong>, a Scottish metaphysician, died. His writings are

caused by the agency of separate immaterial beings.</p>

<p>1774. Battle between the forces of Rohilcund in Afghanistan, and the
subahdar of Oude backed by a British force. The Rohilcas showed great
bravery and resolution, and exhibited a considerable share of military
knowledge; but after a cannonade of two hours and twenty minutes, they
retreated with the loss of 2000 killed, including many of their chiefs;
the country became tributary, and the people robbers and plunderers.</p>

<p>1775. A captain Sears and Mr. Lamb assembled the citizens of New York,
shut up the custom-house, and prevented the sailing of vessels to
Boston, Quebec and Georgia. They sent an express to Philadelphia, where
the same measures were adopted.</p>

<p>1781. Fort Watson, in South Carolina, taken from the British, by the
provincials under colonel Lee. The fort was built on an Indian mound 30
feet high; but the besiegers speedily erected a work which <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>overlooked
the fort, and fired into it with such effect that the garrison
surrendered.</p>

<p>1794. <strong>James Duval d'Epremenie</strong>, a French advocate, executed. He was
remarkable for the violence of his proceedings during the revolution,
and was sent to the scaffold with his old opponent Chapellier.</p>

<p>1795. <strong>Warren Hastings</strong> acquitted after a trial of 7 years. His crime as
charged by the house of commons to the peers was maladministration in
India.</p>

<p>1808. <strong>Murat</strong>, at the head of 40,000 French soldiers, taking advantage of
a faction among the people, entered Madrid and took possession of it.</p>

<p>1809. Battle of Ratisbon. The Austrians, having sustained defeat and
losses four days successively, made some attempt to fortify this city,
in order to protect the retreat of the army. The French, who had
advanced to the storm, were cut down by the musquetry of the besieged.
There was at length difficulty in finding volunteers to renew the
attack, when the impetuous Lannes, by whom they were commanded, seized a
ladder and rushed forward to fix it himself against the wall. "I will
show," exclaimed he, "that your general is still a grenadier." The
French rallied and carried the ramparts—the contest was renewed in the
street, and the city fired. The Austrians were driven out of Ratisbon,
leaving cannon, baggage and prisoners in the hands of the French. Thus
in five days, in spite of the inferiority of numbers and the imperfect
manner in which his troops were combined, Bonaparte, by the sole energy
of his genius, triumphed over the main forces of his opponent, and
opened the road to his capital. At no period of his momentous career,
says Scott, did the genius of Napoleon appear more completely to
prostrate all opposition; at no time did the talents of a single
individual exercise such an influence on the fate of the universe.</p>

<p>1810. Fort Matagorda, having bean reduced to a heap of ruins, was
evacuated by the British, in consequence of which the French were
enabled to bombard Cadiz; 500 officers and 900 men fell into the hands
of the French.</p>

fortune.</p>

built in France.</p>

<p>1838. The English steam packets Great Western and Sirius arrived at New
York, forming a new era in navigation, and commencing a new and
expeditious mode of intercourse between England and the United States.

days, against head winds and a rough sea.</p>

<p>1839. <strong>H. V. Ducoudray Holstein</strong> died at Albany; formerly a distinguished
officer under Bonaparte. After the fall of the emperor he came to this
country, and gained a subsistence by teaching the French and German

carried to the time of his death. He also held several civil offices
with distinction.</p>

<p>1852. <strong>Arthur Condorcet O'Connor</strong> died in France, aged 87. He was a native

Condorcet, and adopted the name of the philosopher within his own.</p>

the author of <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, which was supposed at first to be a
true narrative, and afterwards as erroneously to have been founded upon

the globe.</p>

with obstinate energy. It was the more desperate and deplorable, says
sir Walter Scott, that on the one side fought the flower of the Russian
youth, which had left their universities to support the cause of
national honor and freedom; and on the other, the young men of Paris,
many of them of the best rank, who bravely endeavored to sustain their
country's long pre-eminent claim to victory. Both combatted under the
eyes of their respective sovereigns, maintained the honor of their
country, and paid an ample tribute to the carnage of the day. The
victory finally resulted to the arms of the French, by the superior
generalship of their great leader, and the determined bravery of his
troops. The allies sustained a loss of 20,000, and among them several
experienced officers. The French loss was severe.</p>

men, mounted on horses, and set out for their camp. Arriving towards
morning, they tied their horses, and proceeding about a quarter of a
mile farther, found them sleeping in their huts, without any sentinels
or guard. The attack was so sudden and unexpected that they fled, many
into the river where they perished, and others were killed under the
banks where they had concealed themselves. The Indians at first supposed
they had received a visit from their <em>friends</em> the Mohawks, but the
daylight disclosing the error, and the fewness of their assailants, they
rallied and <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>turned upon their pursuers. The English retreated in turn,

escaped, however, and levied war against the tyrant, who had rendered
himself odious by his cruelties. James was defeated in battle, and put
to death in a mill, by the daggers of his own subjects.</p>

<p><!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>1565. <strong>Adrian Turnebus</strong>, a French critic, died. Great encomiums have been

<p>1676. Attack on Hadley by the Indians, to the number of 700, who were
resolved on a grand effort to carry this post. The attack was commenced
at day-light, with great spirit; they gained possession of a house, and
fired a barn; but were in a short time driven back with loss. The attack
was renewed on other points, the enemy appearing to be determined on
carrying the place; but the discharge of a piece of ordnance cooled
their ardor, and they drew off; and on assistance coming from
Northampton, the foe was driven into the woods, with a loss of two or
three of the English. It is supposed to have been on this occasion that
general Goffe, one of the judges of Charles I, who was at that time
concealed with the minister at Hadley, made his appearance in so
mysterious a manner. At a moment when the people were in the greatest
consternation, there appeared a man of venerable aspect, differing from
them in his apparel, who assumed the command, put them in order for
defence, and by advice and example animated them throughout the attack.
When the scene was over, on looking about for the stranger, he had
disappeared, and was seen no more—leaving the inhabitants to form the
strangest conjectures.</p>

Monmouth was in a short time reconciled to the king.</p>

<p>1734. <strong>James</strong>, duke of Berwick, killed by a cannon shot at the siege of

with the loss of 2000 killed, and all their women, children, baggage and
cattle, taken by the Chinese.</p>

several guard boats; 1500 pieces of artillery, 35,000 stand of small
arms, 12,000 barrels of powder, and a large quantity of shot and shell.
The order of knights from this day became virtually extinct; from a
position of political importance it fell to the level of an obscure
association, and such, as far as human foresight goes, it is destined to
remain.</p>

<p>1798. The Irish rebels defeated with great slaughter at Ballynahinch by

which the bishop of Amiens was greatly enraged, and demanded a
disclosure of the perpetrators. Labarre was arraigned on the false
accusation of his enemy, Duval de Saucourt, and the indictment also
charged him with having passed a procession of monks without taking off
his hat. He was sentenced to have his tongue cut out, his right hand cut
off, and to be burnt alive. This sentence the parliament of Paris
commuted, by a small majority, into decapitation before burning. Labarre
was scarcely nineteen years old, and was one of the latest victims of
that religious fanaticism in France which led to the revolution.

against the execution of Calas.</p>

judgment and sagacity he reposed the greatest confidence, whether in
military or civil career; and of all the American statesmen, he

terms, the soldiers were ordered to cut through the swamp with their
swords, in order to hem them in, till they were begirt in a narrow space

Taking advantage of a dense fog, some of the stoutest made their escape,

in the morning sitting in crowds, sullenly refusing to ask for their
lives, and were shot by dozens or cut in pieces. The male children which

<p>1584. <strong>Balthazar Gerard</strong>, the assassin of William prince of Orange, whom
he shot through the breast with a pistol as he was going out of his
palace at Delft, was executed in the same manner as <a href="#March_28_1757">Damiens</a> (q. v.) and
died, in his own conceit, a martyr of the church of Rome.</p>

<p>1675. Mendon, Mass., attacked by the Nipmuck Indians, and several
persons killed. Mather says: "blood was never shed in Massachusetts, in
the way of hostility, before this day."</p>

Moscow, Siberia and the great Tartar deserts, and did not reach Pekin
until sixteen months after their departure from the Russian capital,
having undergone great fatigue during the journey.</p>

<p>1741. <strong>Edward Synge</strong>, an Irish bishop, died. He distinguished himself for
above twenty years as an active and laborious parish priest; and his
tracts, written in a popular style, have been considered of so much
value as to require frequent editions.</p>

<p>1742. <strong>Richard Bentley</strong>, a celebrated English divine and classical
scholar, died. His editions of the ancient classics procured him a great
reputation for learning, but they were made the medium for retorting
upon his contemporaries, who assailed him on all sides.</p>

<p>1748. An eclipse of the sun observed at London. 10 digits eclipsed, and
Venus seen in a crescent form through a telescope.</p>

<p>1762. <strong>Peter III</strong> (<i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Fedrowitch</i>), emperor of Russia, died in prison. He
acquired the enmity of the nobility and clergy by trenching upon their
privileges, and introducing foreign customs, and was hurled from his
throne by a conspiracy, after a reign of six months, and probably
murdered.</p>

<p>1766. The grand junction canal commenced, uniting the Trent with the
Mersey, and opening a water communication with both the east and west
coasts of England. This great improvement was originated with Brindsley,
who is represented to have "handled rocks as you would plum pies, and
made the four elements subservient to his will."</p>

<p>1774. Captain <strong>Furneaux</strong>, who sailed in the discovery ship Adventure with
captain Cook, returned with the ship, having reached 67° 10´ north, and

gave his message the proper direction.</p>

<p>1780. <strong>Charles Batteux</strong>, a French philosopher, died; eminent for his
erudition and his private virtues, and author of several works on

March.</p>

<p>1789. Marquis <strong>de Mirabeau</strong>, an advocate of Quesnay's sect of political
economists, and author of <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ami des Hommes</cite>, died. He was father of the
fiery orator, count Mirabeau.</p>

<p>1789. Destruction of the Bastile, at Paris. This awful fortress of
despotism, of which the name had for ages inspired terror, and which had
withstood a vigorous siege about two centuries previous, was invested by
a mixed multitude of citizens and soldiers. De Launay, the governor,
displayed a flag of truce and demanded a parley, but abusing the
confidence which that signal inspired, he discharged a heavy fire of
cannon and musketry on the besiegers. This act of treachery, so far from
intimidating the people, inflamed their rage and rendered them
desperate. They renewed the attack with frenzy, and carried the prison
by assault. The governor was seized and massacred, and his head carried
in triumph through the streets. The Bastile was razed to the ground, and
with it the despotism of the French monarchy fell prostrate in the dust.
It cost 200,000 livres to demolish this edifice to its foundations, and
the materials were sold for 36,000.</p>

<p>1790. <strong>Gideon Ernest Laudohn</strong>, an Austrian field marshal, died. He was
commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces, and so high was his
reputation, that Frederic the Great of Prussia admitted that he feared
nobody so much as Laudohn.</p>

<p>1790. Grand national confederation of France, at Paris, in the field of
Mars, when the civic oath was administered. Accommodations were made for

amphitheatre.</p>

<p>1791. Commencement of the Birmingham riots, which were occasioned by the

house, library, manuscripts and philosophical apparatus were totally
consumed.</p>

<p>1794. British squadron captured, on the American station, 14 sail of
French ships laden with provisions.</p>

<p>1795. The British took Simonstown, cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>1796. The British post of Oswego delivered up to the Americans,

marched out the United States troops marched in, planted a standard on
the ramparts, and fired a salute of 15 guns.</p>

<p>1798. Congress passed the famous act for the punishment of sedition,
&amp;c., against the United States, commonly called the <em>gag law</em>.</p>

<p>1808. Battle of Riosecco, in Spain; the French under Gen. Bessieres,
came upon the united armies of Castile and Leon, and defeated them in a
desperate action, in which 20,000 Spaniards perished. This calamitous
battle opened the gates of Madrid to Joseph Bonaparte.</p>

<p>1813. The United States schooner Asp, of twenty men and two guns,
attacked by five British barges; after a gallant resistance, in which
she lost ten of her men and her commander, she was abandoned to the
enemy.</p>

<p>1814. The British schooner Balaboo, of six guns, captured by the
American privateer schooner Perry of five guns, after a running fight of
fifty, and a close action, of ten minutes.</p>

<p>1817. <strong>Anna Louisa Germaine Necker</strong>, baroness de Stael Holstein, died. Her
talents were so early displayed that she was said never to have been a
child, and she became distinguished at an early age as a writer, and by
the spirit of her conversation. She was banished twice by Napoleon for
attempting to thwart his government. Her works form 17 vols.</p>

<p><a name="July_14_1834" id="July_14_1834"></a>1834. <strong>Edmund Charles Genet</strong>, a French statesman, died. He was a minister

Nile. He had reigned over Egypt since 1848. He was very unpopular, and
under his rule the population decreased, and those that remained lived
in great wretchedness. The only remarkable work of his reign was the
commencement of the railway from Cairo to Alexandria.</p>

<p>1856. <strong>Enoch Lewis</strong>, a prominent member of the society of Friends, died at
Philadelphia, aged 81. He wrote much in explanation of the principles
and practice of his sect, was for many years editor of the <cite>Friend's
Review</cite>, and was also noted for his attainments in mathematics.</p>


<h3>JULY 15.</h3>

<p>496 <span class="allcapsc">B. C.</span> Battle of Regillum, in which it is said the twin knights
Castor and Pollux appeared upon white horses and assisted the Romans. In
memory of this event an annual cavalcade was instituted at Rome, during
which the knights, robed in purple, and crowned with olive wreaths, rode
in solemn procession from the temple of Honor to the Capitol, where the
censor, seated on his curule chair, passed judgment on their characters.</p>

<p>238. <strong>Maximus</strong> and <strong>Balbinus</strong>, emperors of Rome, murdered by the prætorian
guards.</p>

<p>1099. Jerusalem taken by the crusaders on the 39th day of the siege. Two
huge movable towers had been constructed, and rolled with great labor to
the foot of the fortifications. From the tops of these they fought the
besieged on even terms till afternoon, when a warrior named Letolde
leapt upon the ramparts and was followed by all the other knights, and
drove the Saracens down into the city. The standard of the cross was
planted in triumph on the walls, and after 460 years of bondage, the
holy city passed from under the Moslem yoke. The victory thus bravely
won, was tarnished by the ferocity of the conquerors. The number who
were slain in the city amounted to 70,000, and the Jews were burnt in
their synagogues.</p>

<p>1535. <strong>Trajan's</strong> floating palace (which was sunk at a great depth in lake
Nemi, Italy, 1340 years before) explored by Marchi in a diving machine.
It was found in a tolerable state of preservation, measuring 500 feet in
length, 270 in breadth and 60 in depth. This magnificent work was
designed for the retirement of a prince celebrated for his magnificent
taste, and were it possible to rescue it from its present position, or
examine the interior, many valuable relics might be brought to light, to
enrich the cabinet of the antiquarian if not to subserve the use of the
sciences.</p>

<p><a name="July_15_1546" id="July_15_1546"></a>1546. The protestants having assembled a force of 70,000 foot, 15,000
horse, and 6,000 pioneers, with 120 cannon, 800 ammunition wagons, 8,000
beasts of burden, determined to support their cause by the force of
arms. They issued a manifesto, and sent a letter to Charles V. (See <a href="#July_20_1546">July
20</a>.) <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>They were, however, overcome without battle, in consequence of
having separated themselves into small bodies early in 1547.</p>

<p>1557. <strong>Anne of Cleves</strong>, one of the queens of Henry VIII of England, died.
The king demanded her in marriage after having seen her picture. But the
painter had flattered the beauty, and the king becoming disgusted with
what he termed a <em>Flanders mare</em>, obtained a divorce and sent her home
again. She retired, seemingly unconcerned, and no doubt considered it a
matter of great good fortune to have escaped with life.</p>

<p>1557. A great dearth of breadstuffs in England; wheat £2 13s. 4d.; malt
£2 4s.; peas £2 6d. per quarter.</p>

and the throne declared vacant.</p>

<p>1610. The Halve Maan, in which the first white man sailed up the Hudson
river, arrived at Amsterdam on her return, having been detained in
England since Nov. 7 of the previous year.</p>

<p>1614. <strong>Peter de Bourdeilles</strong>, lord-abbot of Brantome, in France, died. He
served an apprenticeship in arms under Francis of Guise, and is supposed
to have visited most of the countries of Europe, either in a military
capacity or as a traveler. His memoirs or works were published in 1666,
and several editions have since been printed. It is represented to be a
rare work, but has never been translated into English. (<cite>Biog. Univer.</cite>
says <a href="#July_5_1614">July 5</a>, q. v.)</p>

<p>1685. <strong>James</strong>, duke of Monmouth, beheaded. He was the natural son of
Charles II, against whom he rebelled; and on the accession of James II,
he invaded England, was defeated, (See <a href="#July_5_1685">July 5</a>,) imprisoned and finally
brought to the scaffold, after having made the most humiliating
petitions for his life.</p>

<p>1715. <strong>Bell</strong>, the Scottish traveler, left St. Petersburg for Persia, with
the Russian embassy, in the quality of physician. They were obliged by
the severity of the weather to halt at Cazan and pass the winter, and

the Caspian sea and Tauris to Ispahan, where they arrived in 1717.</p>

<p>1716. The island of Corfu, besieged by 80,000 Turks, and defended by
the Venetians, was attacked by the Turkish admiral with 22 ships, and
an attempt was made by the land forces to storm the citadel; but the
Venetian fleet destroyed that of the Turks, and the garrison, making a
counter sally with 2000 men, took the Turks by surprise in the rear, who
fled, leaving 4000 dead in the trenches.</p>

<p>1751. <strong>John Wilson</strong>, an eminent English botanist, died. His occupation was
that of a shoemaker, and he ranks among the self-elevated men, who
without a liberal education have distinguished themselves by scientific
and literary abilities. He became an expert and accurate botanist before
Linnæus's method of discriminating species improved the science, and
published a <cite>Synopsis of British Plants</cite>. He was the first writer that
attempted a systematic arrangement of indigenous plants in the English
language.</p>

<p>1761. <strong>Dominico Passionei</strong>, a learned Italian cardinal, died. He made a
valuable collection of books and manuscripts, and was particularly
distinguished as the friend and patron of literature.</p>

<p>1789. <strong>Louis XVI</strong>, accompanied by his two brothers, went to the states
general of France, and declared his determination to act in concert with
the <em>national assembly</em>, a title which he then employed for the first
time. They returned on foot to the palace, amid the shouts and blessings
of an immense crowd.</p>

<p>1791. Great riot in Birmingham, England. Dr. Priestley's house and
library destroyed by the mob. His philosophical apparatus was the best
in the world, and his library and manuscripts above price, and not
capable of being restored.</p>

<p>1795. Desperate engagement between a British private armed lugger of 12
guns, <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>and 9 French vessels of 65 guns altogether. The French were

elegant <cite>History of the West Indies</cite>, and other lesser productions,
connected with the islands in that part of the world.</p>

<p>1802. <strong>Thomas Dermody</strong>, an Irish poet, died, aged 28. He was employed as
Greek and Latin assistant in his father's school, at the age of 9 years;
and is said to have written as much genuine poetry at 10, as either
Cowley, Milton or Pope had produced at nearly twice that age. He was, at
the same time, a depraved wretch, and died of intemperance.</p>

<p>1807. <strong>Joseph McKeen</strong> died; an American mathematician, and first president
of Bowdoin college.</p>

<p>1808. <strong>Murat</strong> placed upon the throne of Naples by Bonaparte, under the
title of <em>king Joachim Napoleon</em>. He governed with prudence and vigor.</p>

<p>1815. <strong>Bonaparte</strong> surrendered himself to captain Maitland, of the British
ship Bellerophon.</p>

digits on her northern disk. This is believed to be the 5th eclipse on
record.</p>

<p>622. The Hegira, or Mohammedan era, commenced. It was instituted by
Omar, the second caliph, in imitation of the era of the martyrs,
beginning with the first appearance of the new moon (the crescent), 68
days before the flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina.</p>

<p>1054. <strong>Michael Cerularius</strong>, the Greek patriarch, excommunicated at
Constantinople by the pope's legates. "Shaking the dust from their feet,
they deposited on the altar of St. Sophia, a direful anathema, which
enumerates the seven mortal heresies of the Greeks, and devotes them to
the eternal society of the devil and his angels." The Greeks have never
abandoned their errors, the popes have never repealed the sentence, and
from this thunderbolt we may date the consummation of the schism between
the two churches.</p>

<p>1212. Battle of Tolosa in Spain; the Moors defeated by Alphonso of
Castile. This day became an anniversary festival called <em>The triumph of
the Cross</em>.</p>

accompanied his letter by a present of all the gold he had received from
the king of Mexico, including the two great wheels, one of gold,
representing the Mexican century, curiously wrought, valued at 10,000
sequins, and the other of silver, representing the Mexican year, also
wrought with figures in bas-relief. His object was to prepossess the
king against the representations which might be made by the governor of
Cuba.</p>

<p>1546. <strong>Anne Askew</strong> (or <em>Ascough</em>), an accomplished protestant lady, after
having been tortured, was burnt for heresy. It is remarkable that her
husband was <em>accuser</em>, the lord chancellor <em>extortioner</em>, and the mayor
of London <em>incendiary</em>, in that unmanly work.</p>

<p>1640. <strong>Cornelius Van Tienhoven</strong>, secretary of New Netherland, at the head
of one hundred men, made a rash attack upon the Raritans, who lived at a
small river five miles behind Staten island; the soldiers committed
excesses, which the Indians resented the following year.</p>

<p>1647. <strong>Thomas Anello</strong> (or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Massaniello</i>), a fisherman of Naples, killed.
He headed an insurrection, caused by the viceroy's laying a new tax on
fruit, fish, &amp;c. The sedition continued for ten days, when all kinds of
barbarity were practiced, and Anello became supreme dictator over
150,000 people. He gave himself up to debauchery, and was despatched by
four assassins and his body dragged through the streets with every mark
of indignity.</p>

poison, and spared her husband only because he looked upon her crimes
with indifference.</p>

<p>1691. <strong>Francis Michael le Tellier</strong>, a French statesman, died. He was a
great favorite with Louis XIV, who on a certain occasion treated him
with so much coolness that he returned home from the levee and died in
his own apartment of vexation and grief. He was endowed with splendid
talents, which he exerted for the benefit of his country.</p>

tremendous fire of musketry and grape shot, entered the works at the
point of the bayonet. American loss 98 killed and wounded; British loss
63 killed, 543 prisoners, with 15 cannon and a considerable quantity of

house in the village, before the savages came pouring in, and fired
every other house. The whole number of people thus collected together
was about seventy. They withstood the assaults of the Indians two days,
who kept up the attack night and day, and endeavored to fire the house
by means of poles with firebrands and rags dipped in brimstone tied to
their ends. They also filled a cart with hemp and flax, and other
combustibles, and having set it on fire thrust it backward with poles
spliced together to a great length. A storm of rain defeated this last

solitary thatched cottage, had the curiosity to look in at the window,
when he saw him carving a large cartoon or crucifix of Tintoret, a copy
of which Evelyn himself had brought from Venice. His performances in
marble and ivory were so very fine, that they often required to be
defended by a glass case. Many of his flower pieces are light almost as
fancy, and shake to the rattling of passing carriages. There is no

He stood nearly at the head of the list of post captains, two names only
taking precedence. Capt. Jones, we believe, was a native of Delaware. He
is one of the number who, in the war of 1812, contributed to establish
the naval renown of our country. He fought in the Wasp one of the
bloodiest naval battles in our history, and captured in 45 minutes the
British brig-of-war Frolic of superior force, and under circumstances
highly unfavorable to success. For this action the states of Delaware,
Massachusetts and New York, each voted him a sword in commemoration of
his gallantry, which was in no wise impaired by the subsequent capture
of both the Wasp and the Frolic, when in a crippled condition, by a
British 74. He was afterwards appointed to the Macedonian. Temperate
himself, he deserves honorable mention as a promoter of temperance
among his crew; many seamen were reclaimed by him.</p>

months, when the six citizens, with halters round their necks,
surrendered the keys of their independence. The condemned lives of these

of Chandos's carriage as it passed. Yet Pope's verse respecting the
short-lived magnificence of Canons was prophetic:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <div class="line">Another age shall see the golden ear</div>
    <div class="line">Embrown the slope, and nod on the parterre:</div>

<p>1676. King <strong>Philip</strong> (or <em>Metacom</em>), killed at Mount Hope, in Rhode Island,
whither he had been driven by the English, as a last refuge. One of his
confederates proposing peace, so irritated Philip that he killed him. A
brother of the murdered Indian repaired to the English camp, and offered
to lead them to Philip's retreat. Captain Church set out with a small
body of men, accompanied by a few friendly Indians, and attacked the
chief in his den. He formed his men in extended order, placing an
Englishman and an indian together, with orders to fire on any who should
attempt to escape. At the dawn of day the sentinels alarmed the camp,
when Philip seized his arms and attempted to escape; as he approached
two of Church's guards, the Englishman leveled his gun, which missed
fire; the Indian sent two balls through his body, one of which piercing
his heart, laid him dead upon the spot. When the battle was over, the
English repaired to the place where he lay. He had fallen on his face in
a muddy spot of the ground, from which he was drawn; the head was taken
off and the body left to be devoured by wild beasts. Thus fell a
powerful chief, and a ferocious savage. It was then hailed with joy as
the extinction of a virulent and implacable enemy; but is now often
viewed as the fall of a great statesman and a mighty prince, who died in
defence of his just rights. This was a war of extermination; it was a
general rising of the Indians, under a powerful and sagacious warrior,
against the English, not a vestige of whom would have been left had they
been victorious. As it was, several of the tribes were annihilated; a
miserable remnant of the others incorporated themselves with distant and
strange nations. In this short but tremendous war, about 600 of the
white inhabitants, composing its principal strength, were either killed
in battle or murdered; 12 towns entirely destroyed, and 600 dwellings
burnt. The English triumphed, indeed, but the ravages of the enemy left
them in a deplorable condition.</p>

<p>1689. <strong>Innocent XI</strong> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benedict Odescalchi</i>), pope, died. He effected

<p>1724. Battle of Norridgewock, in New Hampshire, and death of Ralle. He
was a Jesuit, and a principal agent in instigating the Indians against
the English colonies; had resided at this place twenty-six years, and
become thoroughly acquainted with the country. An expedition was fitted
out to destroy his den. The place was attacked by 240 men, and carried.
Ralle was found in his cabin firing upon the English; orders had been
given to take him alive, if possible; but refusing to ask quarter he was
shot down. Eighty were killed, among which were some of the most noted
warriors of the tribe, and the remnant scattered. Ralle was a man of
extensive learning, and of great service to the French; he wrote a
dictionary of the Norridgewock language, which was taken, and is
deposited in Harvard library. He was sent out as a missionary, had
acquired the languages of nearly all the tribes in America, and spent
thirty-seven years among them.</p>

artillery.</p>

<p>1521. <strong>Cortez</strong> retook the city of Mexico, assisted by 10,000 Tlascalans,
and an innumerable host of other Indian allies from the neighboring
nations, whom he had attached to his service. It was not, however, till
after seventy-five days of fierce and almost daily fighting, that he
accomplished his victory. On no occasion did native Americans so bravely
oppose European troops; but the superior discipline of the Spaniards
carried the day: and thus a daring adventurer, regarded and treated by
his countrymen as a rebel, after a bloody struggle, gained possession of
a country which for more than three centuries formed one of the
brightest gems in the Castilian crown. It is computed that during this
siege 100,000 Mexicans were slain and 50,000 died of sickness and
famine. The inhabitants being ordered to leave the city without arms or
baggage, the three roads leading from it were full of men, women and
children, in the most wretched condition, for three days and nights,
seeking an <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>asylum in the open country. The city contained at this time

England amounted to no more than 9,927 pounds, about 9 rounds to a man.
Although this information was communicated to the British by a deserter,
they could not believe it possible that the Americans possessed such
consummate assurance as to continue to invest them in Boston, while so
destitute of ammunition.</p>

<p>1778. The Languedoc of 90 guns, count d'Estaing's flag ship, having lost
her rudder and masts in the storm of the day before, was attacked by the

Concord, containing the old province and <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>council records, and

New Hampshire has a very complete set of its early records.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
